  The product supplied by the seller is a duplicate product.The packaging itself is bad. Most of the packs were not sealed properly - looks like heat sealed ones from kirana shop. The product quality was also flimsy. The perforations on the edge is also not uniform. I had an original one same product from Venus. The material quality of that one was much much thicker than this one. The last photo I have uploaded have both side by side. You can see the even the worn one (on top)  is better than the new one (bottom). Also the perforation at edge do not match.  I was trapped by low price. I do not generally write reviews but this one is so bad I thought I will warn others.

  The mask appeared used, even has one small hair, looking like moustache hair. I had been using this brand of mask for long, but this set makes me feel that few of the set may have been recycled or duplicate, for the lot no is printed separately, unlike the previous ones.

  The product is pathetic and people should be aware of the seriousness of putting these masks on sale. The product is absolute nonsense and not sure if this is a fake product or Venus has simply no control on their product quality check. The fit of masks is of prime importance for N95 effectiveness but the entire lot seems to be defective- the nose clip does not stay in its place and constantly slips below the nose. There seems to be no stitch to hold it in place.Better go for 3M.

  The mask is good but the strap that holds the mask does not give the impression of being reliable.It may give way immediately.As said above, the very second day the loop/ strap has detached from the mask.Some of the packs are also open thereby doubting the sanctity of hygiene.The supplier Elecrama, should give more importance to these factors rather than just make profits.

  Third class quality, I think this seller is not authentic, I have purchased this venus mask from one stockist before, on the basis of that quality I have order this. This masks seems to be like duplicate. Amazon pls look into the matter and ban this seller to protect your name and fame .

"

  Apart from obvious manufacturing defects as seen from above photo, the threads are very delicate, it will pop out if you stretch just a bit more. Quality of mask is less than I expected from my previous Venus purchases. Band attachment has visible holes, nasal metal bar is cross in most of the mask

  The mask ordered from Bajaj Shri group was not even stitched properly. The packing was also not proper. The mask quality was also poor. I have ordered these masks earlier also, but from different seller. Those masks were packed properly, the strings were good, and mask quality was also what it should be.

  Received loose masks right out of the Amazon packet. Forget a box, not even a plastic wrapper around any of them. how can i assume they are clean and not washed old masks? and how they were handled before putting them inside this packet. this is absolutely horrible. and it has no return policy.

  Product is very bad quality. It's smelling very bad when I put it on my nose. I can compare and show you with the original N95 masks of same model . These N95 masks are not original please don't encourage such malpractices and duplicate sellers in Amazon.

"
21,"

  Its slightly different from the mask with same specifications shown on website or supplied in hospital. One labeling is precisely done but Lot No on other side is missing which creates a serious doubt about its being original product.

"
22,"

  For the price, quite reasonable. The masks are comfortable, give good air tight seal, minimum fogging. The strings are strechable and elastic.

"
23,"

  Pack of 20. First pack opened - the strap came off on trying to wear the mask. Next one was ok - strap is very small - not enough to make any adjustments. Mask also very small -fits very tight - feel uncomfortable after some time

"
24,"

  Mentions N95 in the description and the actual product is ffp1.Highly shameful and it doesn't even allow returning it.Absolutely rubbish.

"
25,"

  Worst quality especially don’t buy from seller healthclues. The elastic is breaking on just touching the mask. Useless product.

"
26,"

  The quality was really good last year when I bought, this time around , the letters seem faded, and there are wrinkles on the mask, I hope they are not recycled... Nevertheless, fit is fine, and no issue regarding comfort.

"
27,"

  Straps tear off easily, pasting quality for the starps not optimum, I had to repaste the straps many times.

"
28,"

  Would strongly recommend to discard this product and Amazon should not promote this product as all the masks string gets torn after 1-2 wearKindly refund / send me some other equivalent mask

"
29,"

  The product I received was fake and was very thin like a normal cotton mask. The original looks very similar but thick and give protection. The print and the quality is very low.

"
30,"

  Almost all the mask are either damaged or getting teared while opening it

"

  Original product found it cheper than local market,prompt shipping and good package.

"
32,"

  Good product

"
33,"

  Value and comfort for breathings is goodBut can strengthen the yellow strings as some of them break on 1st use only

"
34,"

  Some of the masks are dirty with dirt across the lower part of the maskAnd some damaged and others get damaged within one or two daysPathetic quality

"
35,"

  strings getting detatched while wearing the masks 25% of the time making the mask useless to wear. SO only 70 to &% % of masks good to wear and the rest go waste

"
36,"

  Very worst product. The back band is very much damaged . Around 15 pieces were unable to use.  Unable to wear it as the band is very much small.  Waste of money

   This mask is not having as many layers a original N95. The string is also not holding and has snapped on the very first use. I strongly believe that this not a genuine product.

"
95,"

  Mask quality is not up to the mark...(in pastapprox.50-60 same model mask were used by me ) and based on that experience i think its not genuine Venus mask... reason why i am saying this...1. mask strap adjustment plastic keeps on moving and make mask loose on fase.2. Material is not that much soft like genuine...So carefull whie shopping mask on Amazon

"
96,"

  This is my second purchase. First batch of Masks were good with Red band but this time I received yellow straps and the quality is not all that great. Already i wasted 3 masks in 2 days as the straps  snapped on the first wear. Please refund or send me good quality ones.

"
97,"

  I have been using venus brand in my hospital practice . So can say this is a fair product . But only things one has to be sure is that you get the authentic one as there are many duplicate ones being sold on amazon itself .

"
98,"

  I have beaing using Venus n95 mask from start of pandemic and it provides great protection.Just we need to wear it properly with nose clip tight and do fit test.Dont spary snatizer/ethanol on mask as it will interfere with static charge that mask fiber has, people think its the fillters which is filtering it but fiber have gap in it at microsopic level a N95 mask fibers are charged to attract and capture micro particles. To maintain that charge dont wash or spary sanitizer, reuse it 2 3 times and discard. Prices of n95 mask has reduce drastically making it affordable for masses hope quality of mask is not compromised. Now it comes with individual package so its much safer now.

"
99,"

  It looks like a fake mask. Nose clips and bonding looks poor. The venus masks purchased previously were good. Change supplier while purchasing and don't go for cheaper price.

"
100,"

  I had earlier bought the Venus mask with the vent (aka selfish mask) and with the rise of covid I decided to switch to a more cosiderate option. The quality of the mask is pretty good, but the yellow straps are of sub par quality. The masks I purchased earlier had the red strap and the elastic was very good quality. I am not sure whether the quality is dependent on the colour of the mask. Within 3 days of use the strap has started showing signs of severe wear.

"
101,"

  Extremely poor quality masks. I had bought them for the comfort of wearing them over the head instead of the usual ear loop masks which pain over long hours. The straps are extremely flimsy. In 3 masks of the pack of 10 the strap tore off right away while wearing it due to the slightest pressure of just stretching it over the head. Another mask when opened from its individual packet had a slit at the chin which made me doubt if they were selling repurposed stuff (see attached photos). Really poor quality and still INR 60/unit. Terrible purchase

"
102,"

  I have been using this product from 1 year and and tried others in between but everytime i have come back to this product. This is good and i observed the layers are of good quality. the best part is its nose clip, it fits well not like others that have air leakage problem

"
103,"

  It's a duplicate product. Bad quality mask material. Too thick. The noseclip comes out and pokes on your nose. Elastic is also bad and becomes loose in no time.

"
104,"

  I found one mask which have shorter elastic band rest is ok and meet standards, I also checked with CDC and fulfill the compliance, for wearing long hours it can hurt your nose and ear but you can adjust your band just to relieve some pressure and pain, somebody might feel little suffocation due to more layers and it fulfill its work.

  Doubt for genuinity.as mask are packed in one polyethe packed and seems that packed by manually.so chances are more for crosscontamination.this brand is good but not sure whether genuine product we are getting.

"
116,"

  The metal strip that sits on the nose is so short that it is useless. The strap breaks off from mask, from the poi t where it is attached. Unlike previous orders, this venus mask package had all 10 masks in a one packing. Highly disappointing, not expected from this brand.

"
117,"

  Finally found a genuine N95 mask. Fit is great.. Covers nose and mouth perfectly and no gaps. Soft material. After trying various substandard, so called n95 mask, this one is real safe bet.Request this brand maintain the same quality, affordable price to save innumerable lifes.

"
118,"

  Worst product don't go for it. I purchased last week the package was not bad at all but the product gave me the worst experience. I started using the product very next day of purchase and 4 out of ten masks were damaged with in few minutes. The thread on the mask is not properly pasted. And so threads which we use to tie on back side of head started breaking with in very few moments after wearing.

"
119,"

  Thing is last time i ordered.. every mask was in separate packet with clear black logo.. and now just one packet having all 10 masks.. mask's logo was greyish.. didnt feel genuine like last time..What to do its like playing a gamble game.

"
120,"

  THE VENUS mask i received good condition ,it is perfect and fine ,I AM REALLY first afraid how will it be but after i seen mask it is perfect , the fitting over head loop method is fine, i trust this is good one.

"
121,"

  Pathetic, straps are glued which does not hold for long and breaks easily. Stapling the straps and using it but the strap even gets torn.

"
122,"

  All the nose pins were out of place. The straps were of poor quality. Half of them were torn. I am surprised that Venus allowed such a shoddy product to be sold. I have always trusted Venus masks. This time I was disapointed....

"
123,"

  The masks are taken from the wholesale package and sold separately. Also they have a strong plastic smell that seems to be a by product of the straps being stuck to the masksThey look like they were repackaged, do not seem original.

"
124,"

  The mask strap came off from the location where it was stuck on the mask.It shows poor bonding material used as well as poor design to adhere strap to mask.The strap came off two masks, both worn for first time.Used several masks before but this is first experience.Had bought this mask as it was NIOSH approved.Quality control at manufacturing is questionable. Cannot say much about the capability of the actual mask as the quality control is very much questionable.

"
125,"

  Quality was not goodStrap easily gets tornthickness was not goodnose clip coming outside outer layer very thin

"
126,"

  The thickness(think protection layer)The stitching qualityThe strap qualityThe wearing comfortThe breathing comfortEverything is inferior compared to the Venus masks that I buy from Local Medical shop

"
127,"

  The quality of mask is not good. The straps of 03 out of 05 (which I have used till now) have teared during first use. I am not sure whether the products are genuine or fake.

"
128,"

  Very good fit and the tie behind the head give the ears a rest. Appreciate the snug fit around the nose. Have been using it for over a month rather frequently. Got good 6-7 full day wears in sun and swear before I had to retire one mask. The white colour shows how dirty it gets, which is good. You know when to stop using. No skin irritation. (Tip: if you go out daily, keep 4-5 masks in rotation and dry them in the sun

"
129,"

  I have bought Venus N95 same model before from amazon which was of very good quality. This one seems fake or manufactured with low quality for less price....it is a very thin mask and also has an unpleasant smell when used for the first time after unpacking.

"
130,"

  Very bad quality of nose clips. Seems to be defective design. Unlike Venus products this one is very low grade.

"
131,"

  Supposed to be individual packet for each items but was 10 pieces stacked together in one package which was not sealed. This is about hygiene which cannot be trusted with such kind of shipment.

"
132,"

  Quality is ok. Stap will come out with little effort. As this mask's stap go round to head so you need to put little strech to stap and it will come out after few repetition.

"
133,"

  Poor quality maskIn image mask is different and I had received different type

"
134,"

  Works perfectly fine and feels safe. The material is good and well priced fir N95 masks

"
135,"

  Comfort value for money and softness. I ordered 10 N95 mask and using from last 3 days. It's very comfortable and easy to wear. It's cover completely. I'm very happy with this product and suggest everyone to go for it.

"
136,"

  this is just a counter fit, original was very good soft quality and strings were much longer, the strings also have good quality in original

"
137,"

  I have checked the TC number of this mask, its available on CDC website which indicates its original but Mask looks not so rigid and very light. I hope its original N95.

"
138,"

  Don't buy... Duplicate product.. Very poor quality..I got duplicate product...But original VENUS proud is very good.. Few seller are taking advantage and making money by selling these duplicate product..

"
139,"

  Strap is detached on little pressure. Mask material is torn on that area. Poor quality of mask material, defaming Venus Brand of mask.

"
140,"

  The masks are very small in size. Won't cover the face adequately. Strange that Amazon has provided no information about the mask size in the description.

"
141,"

  Very soft, each mask is well packed, Venus are the oldest safety gear manufacturers in India, has two adjustable strings to match your fit.

"
142,"

  I have used venus N95 mask before but this one seems fake, strap broke on thw first use only.

"
143,"

  the length of the strap is way too small to fit on to the head and the elasticity of the strap is bad as wellthere should be a mention of size of the strap which is lackingand also the end where the strap is stuck to the mask comes off easily and that's pretty badoverall very disappointing

"
144,"

  Not of a good quality. Material is very thin.

"
145,"

  N95s came individually sealed in their own case. Seems to be authentic Venus masksDefinitely more economical buying on Amazon than elsewhere!Thank you Amazon!

"
146,"

  Masks was packed in a openable plastic with no markings of any manufacturer. Nose clip is short and fits with difficulty. Not loking a genuine products.

"
147,"

  Disappointed during unboxing as masks are of poor quality and already teared off from bottom

"
148,"

  Great quality, real Venus N95 mask, niosh certified seller.As a front line worker I want the original N95 mask.Overall great quality. I like that nose bridge and straps are adjustable. It is worth for extra protection.

"
149,"

  Quality is not goodThey used to be good in quality now mask quality is not good

"
150,"

  Most cheap material is been used, the blended nose guard is not fixed, even the manufacturer has inserted it through a permanent whole...which is visible, sometime ring may come through this...it goes worst after single washed...

"
151,"

  Poor quality mask. Please dont buy this product. As im a doctor i have used many types of N95 this is the worst one i hav ever used.

"
152,"

  good quality product, from all the N95 mask used so far , this is the best for day to day use and for hospital use.but i reordered it 3rd time, and i got a defective mask in the pack of 10 and the price is now 400 rs higher than before

"
153,"

  Strings get detached.....

"
154,"

  Every mask was packed separately.Hygienic and best for daily uses including loops in both strips which helpful in fitting of mask.Thankyou Amazon

"
155,"

  Unsatisfied product. The main defect found was with the strap since it is not stitched or bonded properly instead simply glued which is of no use. While considering the quality part its much disappointing, not up to the standards.

"
156,"

  This is original.. shield packaging.. amazon package also good. Happy to get it..

"
157,"

  These N95 masks are authentic ones. There are many duplicates in market . Thankfully these are original Venus N95 masks. Comfortable and good value for money.

  The same product purchased initially was exceptionally good. May be because of demand the quality has come down.

"
159,"

  Very poor quality. Cant believe that. Used it before, not from amazon. Was satisfied w ith thay. Hence bought 10 via amazone sellers. Strap damaged in the very first use, had to throw away 6 of them. Quite disheartening.

"
160,"

  Previous order had good mask this time I have had mask where thr quality is not good please check

"
161,"

  Totally waste of money never buy I got it checked from venus official customer service they said it is fake

"
162,"

  Good product. As shown in the picture.  Comfortable mask . Good quality

"
163,"

  Not individually packed and sealed in a very dubious way. Makes me not want to use the mask.

"
164,"

  Nice productElastic came out quickly

"
165,"

  It is a fake duplicate item. Never think it is original venus product. It is not original. Beware buyers.

"
166,"

  Why lot number and one more number printed on masks are same on all the mask.. Is it fake and dublicate??

"
167,"

  Venus N95 mask is good but the product which I got from amzon won't look like original N95 mask which I have used from same venus...bcz I was not happy with the thickness of the mask.Good product.

"
168,"

  I think it’s not original Venus N95 mask , 1) no lot no given 2) even manufacturers name is wrong “ Saftey”

"
169,"

  Headbands tearing off very easilyOf the 10, four tore off with the first useNot genuine Venus

"
170,"

  Fake product (its not venus product).then obviously the quality is worst. How do i know ? Before this purchase i have been using venus n95 mask ( same mask ) and its  quality were good.

"
171,"

  As per the price it is definitely the best N95 mask.. Genuine product with genuine lot no. Can go for it.

"
172,"

  Quality is good. But can not comment on efficiency as far Covid protection is concerned. But it appeard to be good.

"
173,"

  One Mask has not stitched, other has Micro holes out of Ten two were damaged Very Bad Service.

"
174,"

  The elastic  strap is just stuck in by glue, so there is chance of pull over when we tighten up the mask

"
175,"

  The head bands don't get tighten and slips. Probably these r fake mask. I've used original venus masks previously. They r really good. But this set is very disappointing.

"
176,"

  Value for money

"
177,"

  Mask contains hair while removing from packing.Few masks doesn't have nose clipStrap is not strong... Damaged on one time use...Quality is not good.

"
178,"

  Perfect fit, very comfortable and feels safe

"
179,"

  Extremely cheap quality. Do not buy at all. Do not recommend this mask for single use even. No protection at all and loose strings and mask got tored the even while wearing.

"
180,"

  very good

"
181,"

  Good quality, looks original with its markings. Soft, good fit.

"
182,"

  The mask came in unsealed cover. Looks duplicate. Strap looks thin and poor elastic. The company name and details  printed onmask  is blurred.

"
183,"

  Used during covid last year and it's very comfortable and worth the price. Since last year I tried other companies mask also but some was fake and some useless.

"
184,"

  Not genuine product. Size very small than original Venus masks. Not recommended at all.

"
185,"

  Nice product.....I received 11 mask

"
186,"

  Nice n good quality

"
187,"

  Best I could find

"
188,"

  Good product

"
189,"

  Very low quality. Masks band is breaking while wearing. Duplicate masks.

"
190,"

  Comfortable

"
191,"

  The mask is good per se but the strings are poorly attached and snap. In 3 cases, the strings snapped before the first use.

"
192,"

  Straps of the masks are loose. Not fitting properly. A malfitted N95 mask is wastage money.

"
193,"

  Last time I ordered the same mask the quality was good. This time the quality of mask is comprised. Not that Happy

"
194,"

  Not like N95 , don't cheat the Customer , corona time sell the original product, other wise don't sell, really not worth for money

"
195,"

  Nose pin should be higher, it’s quite low in the mask

"
196,"

  The strings aren't good. And the black seal breaks off very easily.

"
197,"

  I must recommend this product, really good product

"
198,"

  good product

"
199,"

  Using since 1year. it is easy to use. Very comfortable. It seals so perfectly

"
200,"

  Worst, not durable

"
201,"

  Pathetic. Please don’t buy them.

"
202,"

  Comfort  15% only..value for money 5% cost is too high durability ? Mask nobs gets cutted

"
203,"

  Poor quality of straps. It breaks the moment you try to put on the mask for the very first time.

"
204,"

  The nose clips are all bent on the left side, Thereby not making the mask useful. Ut is a pure wastage of money.

"
205,"

  The strap breaks the moment you try to put it on.

"
206,"

  I compared this with a similar mask that I got from someplace else and there was a clear difference in thickness and feel from inside

"
207,"

  Very bad quality. It's not as good as you see in the pictures.

"
208,"

  Good

"
209,"

  I purchased this product for fourth time. Quality, size is drastically decreased when compared to previous one. Don't buy this.

"
210,"

  Quality product. Checked the TC number on the CDC website. They are genuine products.

"
211,"

  Tha masks  I received were not in a sealed cover and it was not a venus company cover..they we’re packed in ordinary polythene

"
212,"

  Good one

"
213,"

  One piece out of 20 was missing.Some packets were unsealed.

"
214,"

  Uncomfortable. Better to buy from a chemist for more money than buy this for cheap, which is not worth the money at all.

"
215,"

  Fake product. Nose clip gets displaced after few hours. strap are glued to mask which comes off. Fake fake fake

"
216,"

  These are not the original Venus N95 masks

"
217,"

  Venus has decreased the quality of elastic to fix the mask. Mask loosened itselt.So purpose of N95 is not fulfilled.

"
218,"

  Bad quality.No ISI Mark.

"
219,"

  I ordered these masks based on feedback.However this batch of masks is really faulty as the straps give away within 1 or 2 hours of usage.

"
220,"

  Mask comes in an open plastic cover. Safe?

"
221,"

  Rejected lotSome masks doesn't have pinSome have uneven cutsSome have holes

"
222,"

  Worth for its price. Good one. Prompt delivery.

"
223,"

  fake product..just opened it and this is what i got

"
224,"

  One of the very few reliable sources for N95

"
225,"

  I think all the factory rejections were shipped. I ordered 10pcs only a couple of them had the nose pins.

"
226,"

"

"

  I completely dislike this mask the value of the money is good but it's not 7 layer

"
242,"

  Original product and fits well. Much better than the N95 masks available offline.

"

  Value for money, good fitting, feels safe

"

  Fake product. Doesnt match with the original product.

"

  Nice Product... Original. . Seal Packed.. Safe to Buy !!

"
248,"

  Fits well. Elastic strips can be fit to any body because of its movable nature

"
249,"

  This time finishing of mask is not good.

"
250,"

  Product doesn't seem to be original as nose clip inserted by slit in the mask.

"
251,"

  Everything thing is ok but size is small as compare to other products

"
252,"

  Very  comfortable. Worth wearing one.

"

  If the adjustible clip is missing then the mask is not usable.

"

  Nice product.But highly disappointed with delivery as delivery associates refused doorstep delivery .Had to travel 2 km and we collect the item.in this covid pandemic had to go out from home to get essential articles.Very disappointed with delivery

"
337,"

  Poor quality . 50 rs mask

"
338,"

  I returned immediately , it's been 4 months and amazon is not returning my money

"
339,"

  Product quality is good but the tag is getting easily detached while adjusting the mask. Pls look into this .

"
340,"

  It's a reasonable quality product. Good value for money. Fitting is good. Straps tend to become loose over time. Overall good product

"
341,"

  Appears to be as per spec with individual packing. Sealing against bypassing is good. No irritation to skin. Elastic strength is optimum making wearing  is a normal burden , probably no mask can be comfortable. Thanks to venus for bringing such good mask at reasonable rates in present scenario. Please invent to reduce rates so masses can afford them.

"
342,"

  It’s a well fitting mask. But product quality is variable. Lucky if you get those with good nose clips and sturdy strings. But it’s better than other non certified ones.

"
343,"

  True N95 respiratory for 3 times the cost.Very durable and effective respirator as described. Only sore experience was the exorbitant pricing.

"
344,"

  Strap quality is very low , breaks almost every time,  i have to fix it with fevi quick.What a shame.

"
345,"

  Good product. Being a doctor i can say product is std. Strap could have been more fixed(gets detached very easily)

"
346,"

  Recieved product today. Looked and fits good. Did check on quality. Water doesn't pass through, neither from outside nor inside. So satisfied.

"
347,"

  Very poor quality straps which broke instantly while placing on head.  The seller is selling poor quality product.  Wasted money

"
348,"

  Totally 3rd class product. Highly Not Recommend. Don't buy. Elastic bands are not perfect. And even mask material totally not woven.

"
349,"

  Venus is a brand which produces one of the best best quality masks in india.

"
350,"

  Authentic mask

"
351,"

  Out of 10 pieces 7 did not have a ear loop or head loop tightener so it all got wasted . Please take care next time I order it all the pieces are ok to use .

"
352,"

  The mask is perfect

"
353,"

  Worst quality product.All the ear bandss broked within 2nd or 3rd use

"
354,"

  Not at all worthy, cheap quality. There is no wire, we were expecting a good quality one but we are very disappointed

"
355,"

  Average packing not even comes in brand box. Straps are very week  and might lost soon. Better go with another product.

"
356,"

  Actual n95

"
357,"

  Product is OK ,but print is very annoying.

"
358,"

  Definitely not what is expected to be a NIOSH certified product as described. Possible fake. Returned without opening package.

"
359,"

  This mask hast soft fabric which is quite comfortable with good fitting. The straps are over the head and not over the ear. Hence you can wear it for longer time as it does not hurt the ear. This mask does not have a ventilator vent.  Hence even of some one has any virus it will not escape through the valve vent. Over all it is a good value for money even it is a bit costly.

  Masks seem real venus-like, but the nose strip, the quality of fabric, and headband quality is pretty bad.Almost impossible to achieve leak-free fit.

  Fake product. Damaged pieces with fake quality. Dont buy. Amazon also wont accept return for it. Waste of money and time

"

  Very bad...Looks like used ones...

"

  Not worth purchasing, out of 30 masks 7 are without nose clip.

  Masks are just fine in terms of quality. But packing was not done properly. Masks were not sealed in the packet and no sterilization

  Don't have any second thought. It was packed well. Each mask was packed packed and sealed separately.

  I have been using this mask since long ..but so far was buying from medical stores n never faced a problem but this tym i bought a pack of 50 ... runner of almost all the mask r not working n on complaining to amazon was called to directly contact the manufacturer n they can’t help in anyway.. which was so lame .. plz don’t buy atleast from this seller..

"
392,"

  Bought pack of 50 from Bloom enterprises limited.Can confidently say this is genuine. I'm a doctor and am using Venus 4400 for over an year.I was sent duplicate Venus masks by one of the suppliers during the peak of pandemic.This one by bloom enterprises is clearly genuine

"
393,"

  Have been using venus masks since over a year. There are lot of vendors selling counterfeit venus masks. But this is genuine. Superfast one day delivery too. Buy from bloom enterprise. I have received substandard masks twice from other vendors.

"
394,"

  i found a breach in one of the masks while casually looking at the mask before going to clinic.then on i started looking at the masks carefully before putting on .then on i almost found 15 faulty masks out of 50.before this i almost used around 200 masks  and i never checked them on because i was confident that venus masks would be up to the standards.these manufacturers should be prosecuted.i think amazon will not do any thing regarding this issue except for the customer service people very politely saying sorry

"
395,"

  I liked it. I haveen using it regularly as itis NIOSH approved, N-95 mask

"
396,"

  It sis not the original or there is big manufacturing gap as straps are small, it’s smelling from inside once you wear it

"
397,"

  Product looks genuine. Masks are individually sealed packed but not packed in 50 pack. Nose clip is longer and fits well with nose bridge. The fastening strip is bit longer and has to give a knot to make it shot if needed.

"
398,"

  I ordered these masks few days back and opened the delivery packet yesterday. Received the masks in cheap single pc polythene packing . Looks old stock . Quality is also very bad. Strings have no elasticity and are breaking on very less tension. Overall , waste of money . Not worth buying

  Strings are not at all good, they keep coming off and its disgusting as your safety is compromised. Please carry an extra n95 while going out wearing the venus product.

"

  This product is not at all worth for its price....mask thread is of poor quality....when we stretch it while wearing it breaks immediately.....worst product

"

  Previous quality were best but now the masks quality are not atall good.. keeps on breaking, it seems they have degraded the quality, may that be atrips or the placement of metal at top and the material is not sustaining for long..

"
417,"

  Fake, total waste of money. not a guinuine product. I kept order of 50 masks as a bulk,all are fake products,waste of money, among them 10 masks are good but band is not fitting properly.

"
418,"

  Value for money, tying threads can be more softer

"
419,"

  Product not original.... Product received is thin and flimsy not suitable for hospital use.

"
420,"

  The quality is very poor as compared to last lot I purchased 2 months back.It's difficult to retain it on face for few hours unless it's stappled for additional strength.

"
421,"

  Most of the Mask straps are damaged... Even before wearing the strap is torn and the covers are open in most of the masks.. not upto the level of expectation.. waste of money

"
422,"

  I use venus mask since last. 6 monthsThis time I think to buy online for AmazonBut this time quality of tha mask was so poorIn comparison to mask i used before

"
423,"

  it doesnt cover fully and doesnt even create tight vaccum . not n95 standards dont buy

"
424,"

  Good quality but stings are so feable it comes out very easily

"
425,"

  This is a duplicate product. I have used original, so I know the difference.

"
426,"

  Comfortable fit for long hours. N95 for pollution, not rated for medical use. Straps go behind the head, so the mask fits well on the face.

"
427,"

  Dislike

  I would say its ok types but not the Venus original mask types

"
431,"

  Most of the packets are open. Makes me question the quality and gentility of the mask.

"
433,"

  Good. Value for money

"

  strap is not good and quality is not good like red strap venusmask will open in the center

"

  If you are going to purchase in bulk then they will decrease your quality.

  Venus 4400N95 from GDHS is totally waist of money.....there is no lot no or manufacturing date and MRP not printed on outer packet...this is totally fake item.. not Venus original mask.. quality of mask is very poor...please do not buy..

"
440,"

  Durability is very bad one in few masks straps are not attached properly and will come loose when u try to put on it and very few masks doesn’t have attached straps at all

"
441,"

  Inside Loose fibre causes lot of nesal irritation. Initial purchase of pack of 20 was ok but bulk pack is horrible. Fell like removing mask immediately. Red string mask Sr of poor quality.

"
442,"

  Very good and reliable quality. Comfortable too. Even have washed and used it couple of times! This product gives me confidence during these difficult times.

  I bought it with the trust that its being sold by cloudtail. But its very poor quality, loose strings. No N95. Cheating with customer. Cloudtail should not be doing it. Its plain fraud.

   Aa it is as mentioned good product go for it 👍🏻

"
449,"

  I am a doctor and advise to go for it. Good product. Genuine NIOSH certified N95 masks. But comes in 5 masks in one packet. How ever very comfortable. Using for last 2 months as per the guidelines of AIIMS.. that is keeping used mask in breathable paper bag and re using it after 5 to 6 days. You can re use the N95 masks for 5 to 6 times if used for 4 hours a day

"
450,"

  Hi,,Venus mask is perfect mask if u wear whole day. I wear this mask for more than 8hours a day. Best..Now if u want an Genuine Venus mask I guess u buy it from “ Yugan Lifecare” vendor. I got very Genuine product n also compared with what I got from Medical shop.

"
451,"

  Original N95 mask.thanks to amazon.I need again 50 pieces.please make it available again in this price.I will tell all my doctor friends.I am also a doctor in govt hospital madurai.It will be useful for us to save patients confidently and also we can prevent ourselves from  infection from patients.if you do this , it is a real service to the community in this covid pandemic

"
452,"

  Product is good as expected but packaging was ABDOLUTELY BAD. Not expected from seller like ""Cloudtail"". Really disappointing. When other seller is selling this product for less than ₹850 (for 5 masks), I bought it from ""Cloudtail"" @₹1070 because I had trust in them(I have bought few thing from them previously). I think seller should be acting more responsibly while selling such healthcare products as these are very testing times.

"
453,"

  The Venus V-4400 is one of those few models which is actually listed in the NIOSH website as a certified N95 grade mask. A hell lot of the masks being sold as N95 have no quality check whatsoever, and they are using N95 as a brand name to sell off cheap products with no medical use. I have ordered these models before from Coudtail India and got them in unhygienic unacceptable packaging, costing much more around 175 rs. This pack of 5 from Yugan Life care came with each individual mask in a separate sealed plastic cover from Venus. I must say this looks more original  and sterile for a lesser cost per piece. Since there are lot of counterfeits  out there this one at least appeal to my confidence.

"
454,"

  This is not an equivalent of N95 mask. The mask is an FFP 1s . Which only stops 80% of particles. The seller should stop advertising it has N95.

"
455,"

  I m using venus 4400 n95 from last 5 to six months. It was awesome mask.. Very thick... And nose clip was of metal.. Whoch is firm and tight and very good. No gaps.But this time they have send me all duplicate mask... Very thin...  It has plastic nose clips which are bery loose.. It has only 3 layers..  Not five layer like before it is not fitted properly... Waste of money.Government reduces the price but company has reduces its quality. It's fraud.Seller also has changed. Initially it was cloudtail who was sending good original mask.Extremely cheap quality. Lightweighted than before.

"
456,"

  I had bought masks from the local chemist for almost the same price as this -- but these masks are substantially better. They fit better and the elastic at the back can be made tight / lose easily.It says N95 on the mask and I believe them (of course it has to be worn correctly). Fit is good. Breathing through it is not as convenient as the other masks I had. (But I am guessing that is a feature of the n95 mask?)Will not fit well for children (I have a 6yo).

  I have ordered third time bcoz first two time quality was good.But this time very poor quality.Please do not order,I am doctor and this time thickness is no better than 2 rs surgical mask

"
468,"

  Don’t buy!Doesn’t feel like genuine Venus n95 mask, as I have used the genuine one earlier and its much better.The strap gets loose repeatedly and doesn’t hold, so the mask doesn’t fit you properly. The nose clip is too hard and doesn’t adjust properly like the originalIf this is genuine then not worth it as it might be a cheaper version of the original for online sales. The original one I bought from a wholesaler offline was around ₹250 each.Stay away from this.

"
469,"

  This product is substandard.  The mask hardly covers the face, it sits too tight on the face.  The length and breadth of the mask - too small.Most importantly, the length of the head loop too is very small.  This head loop is fit for babies and not adults.Now that everybody is in the ""business"" of manufacturing face masks, one cannot really be sure what kind of mask they will end up with.Not worth the money spent and definitely a waste of time waiting for the masks.

"
470,"

  The masks are good, comfortable to wear, blocks direct air leakages from sorroundings and good at the time of pendamic, I ma wrinting this review after second purchase.. only issue is the strips attached are sticked with glu with masks and may come out anytime.. so ensure you stitch it with thread before use. 1 mask of mine has faulty lock too so I taken out 1 star from my review.

"
471,"

  Very Poor quality of mask A brand new mask had its stitching incomplete causing a gaping hole in the mask just near the nose This is absolutely unsafe and hazardous It defeats the purpose of the supposedly N95 certification for the product I will rate it as poor quality and recommend others to not buy it at all Please take these comments seriously I want an explanation for the defective product and full refund for the same

"
472,"

  I think this is not original because I have already used a original venus n95 mask the same modelThe quality of this mask is very badStrap just broke while wearing for the second timeThe original one's quality was best and the strap was also good... It was good till 3months and this one didn't last for 2 daysFinal Review: Waste of Money  Not Recommended  Don't Buy

"
473,"

  I had ordered this maks thrice because it seems to be genuine n95 mask.However thte third time I bought pack of 5 it's seems of inferior qly and not as per the prev 2 order.The nose pin breaks within wearing of 1-2 hours and there are lots of loose fibre threads inside the mask. The earlier 2 orders I would give 4* but this time not a sinbgle star.

"
474,"

  This is the second set of same mask, I bought the first set in august. But it seems that there's aquality difference between these two sets. The inner cushioning of nose clips are  poor unlike the first set, so after wearing for two or three shifts they are coming out and causing pain and irritation over the nose.  And  I expect , specially from a  reputed company like venus, that quality  must not be compromised  as healthcare workers like us  relies fully on these products.

"
475,"

  Though Venus is a good brand and other masks by Venus have proven good but this particular mask is very poor. Doesn’t fill well. If you tighten it to not allow the air from sides it elastic loop will come out.Elastic loop is just compressed and pasted and is not durable at all. Other Venus masks with stapler supported loop provide better durability and can be tightened without breaking the loop.

"
476,"

  To venus executives, the order which I have placed is a repeat order.The first consignment was excellent and I loved the product.The new version where you have made the aluminium clip smaller. Now, the nose clip refuses to stay in place and air seeps in from the gap between the nose and nose clip.Please fix this so that I can make another order

"
477,"

  The masks look good and are hopefully genuine Venus. We haven't used them much so far. But the packing could have been better, although it wasn't bad. Price seems okay at around ₹100 per piece. The head band is adjustable and goes around the head instead of behind the ear, which is more comfortable.

"
478,"

  When I bought these masks earlier, they were of good quality and would last for some time. However in the most recent orders bought at a price of INR 499, the quality is extremely compromised - the yellow strap comes off while trying on for first time. Now these are selling for INR 250 and one can only imaging the compromised quality. Wouldn't recommened buying these

"
479,"

  I am using this product (from medical stores) from April 2020. First time purchased from Amazon. But very very disappointed as the nose clips of all 10 masks were broken after using the mask once or maximum twice . As I wear spectacles, now these masks are useless for me after so less use. This has never happened when purchased from medical stores.Will tell all my frinds not to purchase the maska at all from Amazon.

"
480,"

  Problem with this mask is that the ear straps break from the masks at a success rate of 80 percentage is not handled very carefully while removing the mask. Though once u staple it by using a stapler then it works perfectly fine.

"
481,"

  1.Poor quality nose clip, plastic nose clip which can't provide snog fitting around the nose.2. Head loop not stiched to the mask , so it comes out easily.3. Mask joinings are not stiched only heat pasted so it can easily gets detached.

"
482,"

  I have received low quality N 95 masks, which are turning black with the usage of few hours. And the straps get detached very soon.

"
483,"

  I purchased this on January 2021, fromThe seller Electrama.I see lot of people complaining about the strap coming out.I found a fix, just use “FeviCry Fabric Glue before using the mask” apply this glue on all strap joints and then the mast will be as strong as expected.This is a genuine Niosh N95 with best rate, only thing is apply fabric glue on strap joints and let it dry for few hours.

"
484,"

  As a covid physician, I hv used Venus face masks... Previously I had bought the mask from Amazon... that was original. Hence I reordered... However  this time the product is fake..  So will not recommend...

"
485,"

  I brought this mask for my travel to Germany. The product quality sucks. Out of 5, 2 were defective. The nose pins just do not work and there is fog all over your spectacles. I would say it's just a waste of money. It is neither an N95 mask. Better buy a cloth mask in your local market which cost 15-25 Rs. This is just a waste of MONEY!

"
486,"

  The material is ok. The nose clip doesnt fit. It is bent at a sharp angle which leaves gap on the nose and you will feel air going in and out through the clip area.Overall it doesn't fulfill the purpose and very risky to use in public places.Moreover since the order can not be placed for quantity less than 2 set, I have got 10 useless masks.

"
487,"

  Excellent product extremely reasonable price very good protection with international niosh rating but the only problem with the product is that the the headband is not at all convenient and the ear band is far more convenient and less risky. Even if you try all tricks of the trade it is very difficult and dangerous to put on and off a headband

"
488,"

  2 very obvious fakes rec'd packed in plain plastic ( out of the 5 ordered).One has a damaged band.

"
489,"

  Straps of two masks were already torn out. Out of two straps, only one is still working. It is requested to send new ones, as with one strap the mask is not safe. Also, straps cannot be tightly fitted.

"
490,"

  Bought from seller Cloudtail.Exactly as described. Knowledge from previous usage confirms that the product is genuine.Loosely packed in transparent covers as a set of 5.Delivered early.

"
491,"

  I got 5 pieces for just 1000 rs. In market N95 is not even available and those who have are selling for 350+. These are really good quality genuine N95 mask.

"
492,"

  Fake product.. please beware .. first mask the head loops were intertwined .. second mask string broke .. third mask string broke .. not after wearing while trying to wear .. please stay away from these cheats .. no return pilicy

"
493,"

  Excellent mask. You can clean wash and use too. Material is very good. But cost is high.

"
494,"

  I ordered 10 of these masks.GENUINE PRODUCTEach mask has NIOSH, N95 written on it.The packet has N95 written on it too.The mask color which I received is grey.

"
495,"

  NIOSH certified claim seems to be genuine.Fitting is good with what is the best part is the adjustable staps to ensure proper fit.Nose pin adapts well.Couldn't afford to do the flame test lest we waste one mask.Great service in times of need for a medical professional like me

"
496,"

  Yes this is not N95 but it's sufficient and it's not fake it's and FFP2 mask which is recommended by ICMR it's good. And it's certified by NIOSH

"
497,"

  Very good, covers most of your face, at the same time, it is comfortable. Slightly costlier than Magnum(which another good mask), but worth buying, considering it's better coverage & comfort.

"
498,"

  Mask are good but the straps are very big. They have a small clip to tighten the mask but it does not work. Need to figure out how to strap the mask securely.

"
499,"

  I was surprised to note that more than half (12 out of 20 I ordered) had the adjusting clip on the strap MISSING. That means I have to tie ugly knots on the elastic straps. Extremely annoying

"
500,"

  The mask serves the purpose. Good for use for the first few times. But after 2 washes it starts pilling which causes irritation and itching while wearing over the nose. Not comfortable for long time use.  Should use better quality fabric to prevent from pilling.

"
501,"

  I am ordering this item for the second time.  First time this was perfect. But unfortunately this time I feel the quality is not up to the mark. Can't wear it at all. The band is too small to wear,so it is breaking. I bought a pack of 10. Used one mask, bands of other two broken when I tried to put, rest I should see. I will post pics too.

"
502,"

  Product seems original and good. However, the seller stole 3 masks from the box. Do not buy from ATOM Wellness seller.

"
503,"

  Pethetic quality and cheap material. I paid money but could not use it for even one time as mask strip got teared. It is as good as disposable 5 rupee masks so don't waste your money. I wanted to give Zero rating but these is no option in Amazon. In these tough times some companies are just making money by fooling customers.

"
504,"

  The elastic bands come off in a single use. They've been carefully stitched, delicately and flimsily so that they break on first use and you buy more masks immediately. How difficult is it to attach a band properly in two places? But why waste a perfectly good pandemic, eh? Till it lasts, keep people buying more masks.

"
505,"

  The images are inadequate. I misunderstood the product to have ear-loops, instead they have top and bottom loops and the locking system to fit ones head doesn’t hold it securely. Buy ones with ear-loops.

"
506,"

  I'm using this brand mask for couple of month. Comfortable for me. I think this will suit the small face people like me. Cause you can use the head band to adjust it.The packaging is little different based on the sellers.

"
507,"

  Very poor quality and jacked up price. Company is a COVID19 vulture.

"
508,"

  Received exactly what I wanted. It’s genuine N95 mask from Venus

"
509,"

  Not sure if it's a genuine product. The strap broke just while trying to put on once. I never thought venus is making such poor quality products and if it's duplicate, action must be taken from the venus.

"
510,"

  I am not happy at all...... it's showing white colour....but delivered grey colour musk... it's quality also not good

"
511,"

  Attachment of strap to the mask is weak and came adrift when worn for the 1st time.There is a strong smell of adhesive or some chemical emanating from mask when worn.I doubt if any quality control procedures exist and in reality if any certification takes place

"
512,"

  Amazing product genuine  v4400 n95 maskAnd i must say amazon is delivering these essential products very fast in these tough times too

"
513,"

  Strap getting detached...then no use. A quality product but cannot use due to this. I am shifting to cloth type.

"
514,"

  many damaged. When ordered for the first time it was good and now it was worst. Went for brand Venus and with my previous experience, but it turned up nasty this time

"
515,"

  2 out of 5 were defective pieces.Never believe this could be the way to fool customers.Dont buy .....Cause if it's defective they don't cognizance and replace it even.

"
516,"

  This is a genuine N95 mask... V good quality soft to wear.. very comfortable and fits properly...

"
517,"

  Very very poor mask quality in terms of making..The strap gets detached easily with slightest pressure and this happened several times admist my ward rounds!!!! Even the mask torn easily in another occassion!!

"
518,"

  The threads snap very quickly and then we have to sew them back on the mask . Brand New mask snapped on the first day

"
519,"

  I bought it with the trust that its being sold by cloudtail. But its very poor quality, loose strings. No N95. Cheating with customer. Cloudtail should not be doing it. Its plain fraud.p

"
520,"

  While the product is comfortable and nice, the quality of the strap and clip are terrible. I had purchased a set of 5 and in 2 of the masks, the nose clip broke in a day and in 2 other masks, the string broke lose.The quality is bad and I would not recommend it.

"
521,"

  Seems like cheap quality item and the price written over the item is 29.40 RS per mask. But payed 499 for 5 pieces.

"
522,"

  The water was leaking from the center joint of the mask when I filled it with some water in it. I doubt that it has all the required layers in it as I have used other N95 masks as well and this mask feels so thin as compared to others.

"
523,"

  One of the Masks out of 5 was found with a hole along the stitching line on front. Rest 4 found Good.

"
524,"

  Received the product today only. 100% original N95 mask. NOT sure where from the negative comments are coming. Will recommend the product.

"
525,"

  I had paid for 5 masks but only two masks have been delivered

"
526,"

  I have ordered a bunch of N95 masks for the past few weeks and this one is definitely duplicate. It stinks when I open it and its in grey color which was misleading as teh coverimage of the product was white standard Venus N95 mask.Dont buy it.

"
527,"

  Box was open and very low grade mask.. nose pin missing.. strap broke at time of puting first time.. amazon take action on the seller.. ewaves retails solution name itseld sound fraud

"
528,"

  Very poor quality..strap broken in two days of use...mask fabric also poor

"
529,"

  The masks are not authentic and complete waste of money.Earlier I have used venus N95 mask, compared these with earlier masks, quality of these mask is local.Do not buy

"
530,"

  Very bad product,Bubble up from the inside so it is not all wareable

"
531,"

  Defective product in packet which we realized later when wanted to use

"
532,"

  Poor quality item...not original venus product..I am a doctor working in covid wards..this is not the original venus N95 mask.the strings broke even before using..fraud...pls don't buy it

"
533,"

  V44++ pollution masks without N95 verification or niosh mark provided. Shameful. White one is by cloudtail and original. Yellow by TFW fake

"
534,"

  Item that I have received is not N95. Also, the metal around the nose area is very loose.

"
535,"

  Rubber straps broken in seconds while wearing , not one two of them.

"
536,"

  Ordinary quality, not upto the mark. Whatever picture given in the site , different when I got it. I""ll suggest not to buy this product with such huge MRP.

"
537,"

  Headband of one mask was not fixed with the mask. But mask bear NIOSH MARK. Manufacturer should be more careful in production and quality checking.

"
538,"

  Not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from, but in Mumbai, got the right mask. N95 stamped, as described

"
539,"

  Poor quality . one strap detached from joint with mask within 4 day. Needs frequent tightening of strap to avoid mask slipping down the face.

"
540,"

  written price on mask and purchased price is so much different, huge variation so doubt on quality of N95, also not given N95 certificate

"
541,"

  Received defective product and the straps are gone at first use..

"
542,"

  It's a NIOSH mask. Fit is not very good but better than the majority available.

"
543,"

  I have been using venus n95  since last 6 month...this time i got a fake product...i can tell u from feel of the masks ..dont purchase it

"
544,"

  It was rapid quick delivery from punky punnu e commerce and the n95 venus masks are also upto the mark and quality wise it is good. Full credits to quick  delivery than the estimated date.Not sure about durability have to see that

"
545,"

  Poor quality. Somenod the mask gets teared while wearing. Joints of the mask gets teared while wearing.

"
546,"

  This is certified N95 mask the best at a reasonable price thanks amazon

"
547,"

  Very poor quality... Tear off easily. Straps come off easily.

"
548,"

  Fake they are selling .... duplicate copy not even worth 10 rsThts why thy are selling it as not returnable

"
549,"

  Broke loose the elastic of 3 masks in a single day. Not durable at all.Typical ""Make in India"" product!Buy the 3M N95 masks.

"
550,"

  5 pieces received without any box . Only 1 piece was in sealed plastic cover and the remaining 4 plastic covers were in open cover. Appears to be refurbished and unhygienic item. Not at all recommended.

"
551,"

  I think they send me ok ok product to me so again i Just ordered a new pack of 5 let see what they are sending now according to the product review i m in doubtful mode lets see as i will receive will update here.

"
552,"

  Such perfect masks with hole in between...  Totally solves the purpose of wearing the mask .. out of 5 masks, 3 came with a hole on the nose

"
553,"

  Confident protection , been using the same model for almost 6 months now .

"
554,"

  The material is extremely good. The only problem it gets dirty very soon because of the colour. The fabric, the adjustable strap, etc is very good.

"
555,"

  Waste of money. Even string got detached just single use. It has hole in it...!

"
556,"

  Very bad quality

"
557,"

  Thanks for delivering the product. Though it is of different color and image as shown in the website, however, from google came to know that the delivered product is also of the same type.

"
558,"

  Not an useful product...Ordered 10 mask most of them are torn in the rope or in the centre of the mask...and the filtration layer is also not uniform some places thick and some places thin...waste of money...

"
559,"

  Very uncomfortable! Everytime it comes off from my nose...even the strap does not make it hold. Material is not bad but not serves the purpose if it comes off every now and then.

"
560,"

  Worst product... I would like to return it but unfortunately this product is not eligible under return policy.I thought its branded... It's duplicate one... Very much disappointed

"
561,"

  Don't buy not worth it, length of the strap is too small. All the crap gets in your mouth of you wear it.

"
562,"

  The product is not same as in the picture, I had specially ordered because it was White.The polly bag containing the Masks is smaller than the Masks making it squeeze inside, Now the SHAPE is not normal

  The product is not genuine as the bar code does not give any result about the product.

"
564,"

  Clearly a fake product. Do not buy.

"
565,"

  Thickness and it seems like used or fake

"
566,"

  This mask has a pungent smell on opening. You need to keep it open for a day before using it... Otherwise not much problem

"
567,"

  Quality is very bad feeling used product gave. I bought this venus company mask before I got good mask but this time I feel cheated by venus sent bad quality mask😡😡

"
568,"

  Counterfeit product. Thin layers. Becomes discoloured from the outside with a single use.

"
569,"

  No so good qualityLooks duplicate as my earlier purchase was much better in quality

"
570,"

  Straps got broken within ten minutes of use. Dust particles within the pack. Not sure if the product is original

"
571,"

  Mask is torn and it’s not usable ..the fabric is very thin ..we have been using Venus N95 since 1 year ..this is the very first time it’s like this ..I need my money back as it’s duplicate

"
572,"

  worst products. I have ordered the same product (venus v 4400 mask) repeatedly from other dealers also. but this time they supplied very poor quality masks. do not order. wastage of money.

"
573,"

  One of the masks was dirty on the outer part of the mask. Clearly, proper procedures aren't being followed while packing these masks.

"
574,"

  The mask is not comfortable to wear. Although it does the job of safety.

"
575,"

  this product might mostly be fake , the size was smaller and also thicknesses was not as other venus n95 i have owned previously

"
576,"

  So the image I uploaded says it all, the elastic breaks apart while you get to wear these masks, it's not just with 1 but with all masks (set of 5)

"
577,"

  Straps came out in 1 ek use even after twice in one week use

"
578,"

  Very low quality

"
579,"

  Duplicate products, Cheated  me. Why you sold like these products on your online store.Please  don't buy n 95 mask online. Every time I received duplicate products.

"
580,"

  Excellent product Lasts well Fibres don't come out soon like magnum Comfortable to adjust strap

"
581,"

  It's FFP1 mask not N95। Quality is good।

"
582,"

  It is a local and bad quality product do not buy

"
583,"

  Best in class

"
584,"

  Loops break

"
585,"

  Difficult to breathe thru it

"
586,"

  Product feels good but the  strap is broken in most of the masks.Pathetic quality control

"
587,"

  Received product as described

"
588,"

  It is not a original venus mask.it is a duplicate one.quality is very poor

"

"

"

  Dirty and used mask delivered.🤮

"
592,"

  Excellent Product with superb Value for money!!!

"
593,"

  The mask which I have purchased is not upto the mark. In one of the pack....the tag is short and no adjustments can't be made... felt unhappy with this product...

"
594,"

  Not of good quality..the strap easily breaks off...has used N95 venus masks previously..but this is of poor quality...

"
595,"

  The masks are not sewn properly and the metal strip in the mask is bent downwards or is coming out of the mask

"
596,"

  Original mask. good value for money

"
597,"

  Hope it will give us full protection

"
598,"

  It came with nice elastic and holding pins to tight easily and loose easily.Good one.

"
599,"

  Best right now

"
600,"

  Price is More for the Product

"
601,"

  Good..

"
602,"

  For safety

"
603,"

  quality is not upto the mark

"
604,"

  It's not an authentic product. The straps came out on the very first use. I have a previously bought venus mask, it's way better than this one.

"
605,"

  Just used mask one time and the strings broke, its a waste of money, duplicate product, the vendor should refund money and stop fooling people

"
606,"

  Duplicate masks. BEWARE. I have been using these same brand since March and these were definitely duplicate.

"
607,"

  Product is different from what shown in display. Not happy with the way marketting is done. It is unfair. Quality not up to the mark

"
608,"

  Fake product for N95 madk

"
609,"

  I bought it thinking that these will protect from viruses, but shocked to know that it doesn't protect from Viruses.

"
610,"

  ok with this price

"
611,"

  No foam padding below the nose clip. Pricks your nose. Otherwise it is a superb mask.

"
612,"

  Extremely unsafe mask it got open in front on the first use

"
613,"

  As compared to venus 4400 mask I had before these are coarse and rough and poor quality.  I DONT KNOW IF THESE ARE AUTHENTIC OR FAKES

"
614,"

  I did not find it value for money. It doesn't fit properly

"
615,"

  Welding of Elastic not good breaks easily. Nose Clip is of very low quality it doesn’t retain the grip 👎

"
616,"

  Ordered 5 packs got only 24 pieces instead of 25.

"
617,"

  It is ok to wear but price is too much regarding this product

"
618,"

  good mask. good quality

   Some masks are tored and others have broken wires.

"
620,"

  Strap of the mask detaches very quickly. Initial orders of the same products were good. Feeling that quality is getting worse.

"
621,"

  I have used a lot of mask from different brand in amazon. This is the best one. Go for it. But price is high

"
622,"

  Average quality, the strings are very weak. If you are right on a budget go with this. But I don't recommend this. It's not durable.

"
623,"

  Duplicate venus mask....dont buy

"
624,"

  Ordered for 5 masks, BUT received only 2 masks. Unhappy....It could be a oversight, but....

"
625,"

  Defective product strings of 03 mask out of 05 are broken or not attached

"
626,"

  The mask is made of very light material (tissue paper kind of material). Also the nose clip is not perfectly adjustable.

"
627,"

"
628,"

  Yellow strip is not good... After 2 hours of usage or while removing strip was tared. Thinckness is also not good.... Not worthy

"
629,"

  thesmasks are fake straps break apart when u try to put it on i have been using venus masks as i am a doctor but these are fake

"
630,"

  Everything as advertised. No complaints whatsoever.

"
631,"

  Quality issue ... Cheap and looks like washed and resold

"
632,"

  It seems original product. N95 printed , packing also nice. I am fully satisfied .I recommend every one to purchase .

"
633,"

  looks like a used mask to me bought a new one in store which feels completely different

"
634,"

  its badly fit and thickness is too loo from original 2019

"
635,"

  Mask is good but less is different color ,i m buying red color but receive yellow color.i m not happy

"
636,"

  This is not an original and it's missing a thick layer. Amazon should validate before promoting them.

"
637,"

  Satisfactory fitting and over all quality is good

"
638,"

  One mask is torn at two places. No return as per policy. So I need to move consumer's court.

"
639,"

  I ordered these two times as one my friend said product quality is good

"
640,"

  Strap are weak and not attached properly,  after two three use its come out

"
641,"

  It works! I couldn't even smell the foul smell outside after wearing this

"
642,"

  Quality is not good while comparing other N95 Masks

"
643,"

  Good mask but durability is very less within 1 week it worn out

"
644,"

  Good quality product at reasonable price. It will be used by our office employee as a protection from Covid 19

"
645,"

  One strip of mask is torn at the end of one day usage ..strip is pooly attached to mask

"
646,"

  Very good product

"
647,"

  It's a duplicate product. The strings get cut off while pulling and wearing. They ain't strong. Bad quality.

"
648,"

  All the masks had a gap in the seam in the front, probably rejects from quality control. Absolutely no use in filtering air.

"
649,"

  Worst mask..third class quality...please don’t buy it..it is better to have disposable mask...I want to return it

"
650,"

  Good Product, Using it from last 2 Months,  well Quality..

"

  String was not proper.It was detached  from mask.

"

  This is the 2nd lot of this product that I am using.The experience with the first lot was excellent, be it thickness comfort or value for money. So much so that I was recommending other people to buy it. But the 2nd lot was terrible, no comfort, very thin poor quality fabric, poor fitting leading to fogging of glasses.I feel the drastic reduction in price in order to complete with others led to this dramatic deterioration in quality. I sincerely hope the manufacturers look into the matter.

"
768,"

  If it says its N95 or FFP2 S its worth buying.If it is FFP1 S It would not protect from the corona virus at all.FFP1 =Surgical MaskFFP2=N95 RespiratorFFP3=N99 RespiratorI am a doctor.Please have some trust.

"
769,"

  I bought these masks.. But they were never delivered. Amazon refunded my amount.But my review is based on the same masks which I bought from local market. Masks are good but air seal near nose area does not occur 100 percent.  Venus should improve the quality of nose clip used

"
770,"

  It is not an in 95 mask, because on the display image it is written as ffp1 which means that it can prevent 80% of the viruses/ particles on the other hand and 95 mask can prevent 95% virus.But its better than cloth mask or surgical mask which prevents 50%

"
771,"

  An average mask cloth mask is better than this. Not worth even Rs100

"
772,"

  Pathetic marketing strategy , it's not even N95 an they are doubling the price . Pack of 5 costs 1500, where as the actual price cost just 100-150 per mask. No ISI mark on it

"
773,"

  The product has all the telltale signs of a counterfiet. No LOT number, no TC number. Its a shame that counterfiets are sold just a make a bit more profit.

"
774,"

  After checking out NIOSH website, I found out that this particular type of (product) mask that is having a model number V4400N95 has got approved and its approval number is 84A-8126. Anyone can cross verify it.

"
775,"

  Genuine product if ordered via Cloudtail as a seller.. Not as good as a 3M Mask but absolutely does the work

"

   The mask is undoubtedly NIOSH certified N95 mask, I verified the lot no. (There will be NIOSH N95 and lot no. stamped in black ink on right cheek side of mask)CONCLUSION:  I have used 3M N95 masks earlier, 3M masks are far better than these Venus masks. Venus masks definitely lack in overall quality control. But considering current situation knowing that it is NIOSH certified N95 masks and affordable. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED.⚠️⚠️ NEVER wash the mask NEVER. These masks loses filtration capacity if washed. After usage if the inside surface feels moist then sun dry the mask and preserve it in plastic wrap then wear the mask after 3 days. (Doctors are doing this in shortage of N95s).👍No size issue. One size fits all size face.👍The metal nose clip is good and flexible thus having no gap in ridges of nose.👍The fabric of mask is soft, flexible and breathable thus comfortable for long usage.👍The heat stiching on and around the mask is neat and clean leaving no pores thus sealing mouth and nose properly.👍The elastic straps are good. They have an adjusting mechanism to tighten the mask properly. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The straps are soft and doesnot create pain around ear or neck after prolonged usage.👍The inside surface of the mask is very comfortable to wear for long as all the adjoining points of straps and noseclip are properly concealed into layers of fabric.👎🏿In some masks the end of the straps was not not properly heat sealed onto mask surface. Don't know the durability of those straps.👎🏿Need improvement in heat sealing around the rim of the mask (in some masks, not all of them)DIRECTION FOR WEARING AND MAINTENANCE:1. Never touch the inside of the mask.2. Try not to touch the exterior of the mask frequently.3. Hold the mask by the straps while wearing and taking off.4. There are 2 straps first wear the lower strap around the neck and then wear the upper strap around your head over the ears.5. Then tighten the straps by the adjustable rings provided one for each straps.6. Pinch the nose clip such that airtight seal is formed inside mask.

"
793,"

  The Venus masks are very reliable but the same cannot be said for the elastic bands that come with it. It's often frustrating to feel the elastic break /come off as you are spinning in a fresh out of the box mask. But having said that, it's still the one brand I have kept reforming to throughout the pandemic because of its comfort and reliability a mask. I should know. I am a health worker.

  Got original product when ordered initially but received fake used pieces when ordered again

"

  It’s cheating..!! Not original..!!Totally different from description given..!!Now after delivery no one is addressing my complaint.. !!Total losss of money and faith in Amazon .

"
830,"

  Received what seems to be surely a fake product, the irregularly sealed packs contain human hair inside them!!! I'm a health care professional and use Venus products on a daily basis; believe me this definitely doesn't seem to be from Venus, there are other attributes that suggest the same like extremely poor strap quality with zero elasticity, fasteners that doesn't hold, faded inking on the mask indicating lot number and other details. (Seller: Electrama, fulfillment by Amazon)

"
831,"

  Very Cheap Quality, it's  not an Original Venus , I am an medical professional , I am using this same model  mask for a long time but Original one is very Good ,but this product is very poor in Quality, please Don't buy this product, waste of money , I  request Amazon not to permit and encourage such kind of sellers , please assure the product before posting , it's an offence because this is a fake product of Venus sold in Amazon , I don't know how Venus company will allow such fraud to happen

"
832,"

  The product I received was looking just like the original mask but when I started using it, I could notice the difference between the mask which I used before and this one. The threads in this mask comes out very easily. It also had some volatile chemical smell.I could not return the product also. Overall, it was quite a bad experience for me and I felt like I have been cheated on this platform.

  This is the 2nd time I am receiving a defective item. Not in the packaging shown against the ordered item. The random mask I picked up appears washed!!!***A. The package that I received was not in the package shown in pictureB. The masks are in individual covers and seem to be original BUT the 1st mask I picked up for use appears to be washed and lint from the texture and band is clearly visibleC. Found a spec of dirt when I opened the first oneD. I got a sneeze as soon as I wore the 1st mask I openedE. This is NOT the same Venus masks that I am used to since last year

"
834,"

  Venus has reduced the length of the strap, earlier it was easier to wear now straps get easily torn off due to increase tension in strap Because of decrease in length of strap

"
835,"

  Product is not up to the mark at all. Nose clips are made up of plastic, not properly fir. Holes around the connection area of straps. Those are bought from shops are of much good quality. Seems there is some different product is sold on Amazon.

  Fake mask, very poor fit, low quality tieBEWARE !!!FAKE FAKE FAKE !!! WASTE OF MONEY

  Seller Electrama.Product didn't come in sealed Venus packing shown in picture. The printing on mask is faded and the mask looks fake to me. Product is non returnable so can't return but disappointed with seller.

"

  Got original product when ordered initially but received fake used pieces when ordered again

"
839,"

  It’s cheating..!! Not original..!!Totally different from description given..!!Now after delivery no one is addressing my complaint.. !!Total losss of money and faith in Amazon .

"
840,"

  Received what seems to be surely a fake product, the irregularly sealed packs contain human hair inside them!!! I'm a health care professional and use Venus products on a daily basis; believe me this definitely doesn't seem to be from Venus, there are other attributes that suggest the same like extremely poor strap quality with zero elasticity, fasteners that doesn't hold, faded inking on the mask indicating lot number and other details. (Seller: Electrama, fulfillment by Amazon)

"
841,"

  Very Cheap Quality, it's  not an Original Venus , I am an medical professional , I am using this same model  mask for a long time but Original one is very Good ,but this product is very poor in Quality, please Don't buy this product, waste of money , I  request Amazon not to permit and encourage such kind of sellers , please assure the product before posting , it's an offence because this is a fake product of Venus sold in Amazon , I don't know how Venus company will allow such fraud to happen

"
842,"

  The product I received was looking just like the original mask but when I started using it, I could notice the difference between the mask which I used before and this one. The threads in this mask comes out very easily. It also had some volatile chemical smell.I could not return the product also. Overall, it was quite a bad experience for me and I felt like I have been cheated on this platform.

  I have been using this mask regularly now. When I order a pack of 5 or 10, the packet is not Air sealed. I thought to buy this pack of 50 because it promised to be Air sealed. I got a new Air sealed packet, however, the straps are not attached in a good manner. The strap gets broken easily. I have checked the straps of same model of the mask from other batches and found that it's joined in a clean and robust manner.I request the seller to please clarify why this Air sealed pack of 50 has different types of straps?

"
872,"

  Masks came in 2 boxes with 25 pieces of masks in each box. Each mask was packed in  individual cover which makes us feel safe in these covid times. Masks are original and niosh certified , go for them without any hesitation. Keep it up seller & amazon 👏

   The mask is undoubtedly NIOSH certified N95 mask, I verified the lot no. (There will be NIOSH N95 and lot no. stamped in black ink on right cheek side of mask)CONCLUSION:  I have used 3M N95 masks earlier, 3M masks are far better than these Venus masks. Venus masks definitely lack in overall quality control. But considering current situation knowing that it is NIOSH certified N95 masks and affordable. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED.⚠️⚠️ NEVER wash the mask NEVER. These masks loses filtration capacity if washed. After usage if the inside surface feels moist then sun dry the mask and preserve it in plastic wrap then wear the mask after 3 days. (Doctors are doing this in shortage of N95s).👍No size issue. One size fits all size face.👍The metal nose clip is good and flexible thus having no gap in ridges of nose.👍The fabric of mask is soft, flexible and breathable thus comfortable for long usage.👍The heat stiching on and around the mask is neat and clean leaving no pores thus sealing mouth and nose properly.👍The elastic straps are good. They have an adjusting mechanism to tighten the mask properly. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The straps are soft and doesnot create pain around ear or neck after prolonged usage.👍The inside surface of the mask is very comfortable to wear for long as all the adjoining points of straps and noseclip are properly concealed into layers of fabric.👎🏿In some masks the end of the straps was not not properly heat sealed onto mask surface. Don't know the durability of those straps.👎🏿Need improvement in heat sealing around the rim of the mask (in some masks, not all of them)DIRECTION FOR WEARING AND MAINTENANCE:1. Never touch the inside of the mask.2. Try not to touch the exterior of the mask frequently.3. Hold the mask by the straps while wearing and taking off.4. There are 2 straps first wear the lower strap around the neck and then wear the upper strap around your head over the ears.5. Then tighten the straps by the adjustable rings provided one for each straps.6. Pinch the nose clip such that airtight seal is formed inside mask.

Didn't came in any original packing. Also instructions received as a photostat. Very Very Poor Experience...

"
914,"

  Was unsure about getting these initially because of the mixed reviews. But I'm really happy with what I've received.These are almost as good as the Honeywell masks I had (They're not available anymore so I was looking for alternatives). The delivery packaging was great. The masks I got are white, with yellow straps. The manufacturing quality looks really good - the straps are nice and thick, slightly elastic. The corners have even perforations and are don't hurt while wearing. The straps also have a small tightening clamp at the back to adjust the length of the string. The metal pin near the nose doesn't seem flimsy either; it holds its shape nicely. Having the straps around the head is good because my Honeywell masks used to go around the ears and hurt after a while. These don't have that problem either.

"
915,"

  For those using n95 mask knows, its special because of charged fiber which can attract very small parricles which flows with airintake.If you disturb the charge its microsopic holes are not able to trap virues and deopplets.Have being orering this 3rd time, cloudtale was the best seller, later some yuhan lifecare.The nose clip quality is no more good, its very thin and flexible this time and allows hot out breath to leak, so intake will also have same issue. As seal is not tight cant recommend this now, price  has deopped so as the quality of mask. Go for something else or see at medical store before you buy.

"
916,"

  Got a proper N95 mask after trying many products. The packaging is not great but looks authentic. Buy from cloud tail only if possible.

"
917,"

  These look really identical but are NOT Genuine Venus 4400.Compared to 2 genuine Venus 4400 masks that i had bought one day before lockdown that are still working good after 6 months & a hundred (careful) washes.Thinner mask. The material is different - less soft.Nose Clip is smaller & placed slightly higher that makes the fit slightly loose at the chin.Elastic is lower quality - less stretchy.All said. These are not bad copies & still look Useable as long as the elastics last.___Edit after using.Nose clip came loose & displaced in 2nd time use.Very bad Quality.

"
918,"

  Genuine Venus N95 with TC No ... Very good fitting all around face... Nose clip is good quality... Head straps are good quality... Breathable and comfortable ... Only cons is very bad packaging ... The masks were folded inside a very small cardboard packet due to which the masks got crumbled...

"
919,"

  So I’ve ordered the pack of 4 and I found 3 of them are damaged. Loops broke when I tried to pull while wearing. I think you probably will face the same issue as well because the loops are attached through some hot rod technique or something loops are not attached with pins. So it probably will come out easily. I recommend you guys not to buy this particular loop type masks.

"
920,"

  when i bought this venus mask at local medical store, that was original N95 & completely reliable.But in Amazon, these are very thin & also I'm skeptic about that, whether it is original N95 or not. My recommend is don't buy any mask in online, specially in this crisis time. Though you have to pay some more money (approx. ₹100/mask) in local medicine store, but it'll be better as you could check that properly.As health is our 1st priority at this time, not some money.

"
921,"

  There is distinct,perceptible decline in the quality of workmanship. As a result, the elastic comes out of the hole in the mask, rendering it inusable and unworthy. Tragedy that you pay heavily and await its receipt for use only to be disappointed at these very critical times. Luckily  similar products are available at known shops and you are not left all at risk.Unfortunate that covid times have become a chance to maximize opportunity by hoodwinking others

"
922,"

  First and foremost i doubt if these are original as name printed is faded and i have been using these mask which i bought from local chemist shop and were of perfect quality and thickness which can not be said for this product which i have received. They were not even packed individually which usually is the case. So all in all it seems to be a fake product. I mean if i aanted this qaulity i would have bought any cheap mask. Hope i am wrong (i know i am not).P.S. I had to buy online as it was not available locally.

  The worst mask ordered ever!!! The photos attached show the date of the mask after the first use. The manufacturer has simply used low quality stick or whatsoever which facilitate easy "" coming off"" of the strings. A pack of 4 N95 masks done and dusted in 4 days. I seriously doubt the genuineness of this product. Amazing should call off any deal with this dealer immediately. If I don't get a reply confirming action against this seller/manufacturer, I swear I am gonna Sue the seller as well as amazon for facilitating such a despicable act of cheating in a consumer court..

"
934,"

  straps are very weak in my firat order. it tore in just 3 days.I ordered 2nd time and found the seller might have sent duplicate one. I never open the packets till now. and when I opned it today3 of the 4 masks totally opened up the stitching. it is far far worst product and waste of money.. please go for some other N95 masks otherwise uou will loose money like me.

"
935,"

  Bought it for a second time. First time the quality was very good. Straps were good and face was covered and I couldn't smell anything outside the mask (a quality every N95 mask must have).This time though, the straps are very weak, mask doesn't fit well(loose fitting) and is also quite thin and I could smell outside the mask.The packaging was also very bad when I received it in a plastic bag inside a basic Amazon cover.

"
936,"

  Product is good very soft and comfortable. Only problem is the strap which is very brittle and breaks on just a pull. Waste of money if you can’t use it for more than a day the strap breaks very fast . I don’t recommend buying these masks unless the manufacturer improves quality of strap

"
937,"

  Very bad experience to buy this time.. I put order pack of 4 * 3 but you are send 12piece with 2damages then that strap is not stick Properly.. We are put order based on low prize but you are made loss.. If all mask damaged means we can return.. If one or two damages how can return.. This is your business plan..

"
938,"

  Bought pack of 4 Venus V 4400 masks from seller 11 Pharma. To confirm that these are genuine, seller also sent the pick of original box of 25 masks from which it was taken, which has lot number and all details, on my request.Thus can confirm that 11 Pharma sold genuine masks to me in this purchase.

"
939,"

  It is worst mask I have ever seen. On the first day of wearing, the stich from nose point to throat point completely broken and cloth fell apart. I could take fresh air without mask on my nose. It happened in market place. People told me that my mask has teared. Bye Bye Venus Brand.

"
940,"

  Excellent product. But please check seller. It was from Cloudtail India Private Limited bcz I have horrible experience previously with ABC sales with same product but  Amazon had refunded full amount after complaining. Thanks to Amazon.

"
941,"

  Today, the market is full of Duplicate Products in Venus Masks. I tried in several places, always got duplicate material... This is actually original and I could feel the difference while using it. Thanks for providing the original products.We all should say no to FAKE.

"
942,"

  I had made order for this product 2nd time, first time it was good thickness comfort but wen i got by 2nd time it was not upto our ecpectation. I think the manugacturer has made very low quality product this time & 2 pcs  stitch was already broken wen i checked kindly improve your quality.

"
943,"

  Last month I ordered the same product.It was quite good except the fact that strings attached are too weak and have to use staplers to stick them..But still it was ok..This time I reordered the masks but they r low in quality..Fabric is thin and they are not snuggly fitting..being a doctor I need good masks but felt a bit disappointed this time.

"
944,"

  Mask are so good, provide snug fit on your face, no air leakage from any side, Only concern is packing, comes in loose pack and seller cloudtail have sent me them by folding mask....

"
945,"

  Really worth. Genuine NIOSH approved N95, can be checked on cdc website with TC number. 5 stars for comfort. Highly recommended especially for health care professionals.

"
946,"

  String pulled up easily from gum site otherwise good.

"
947,"

  Marked difference in quality from 2020 when the lockdown started and now in 2021. They are deliberately manufacturing substandard products now. Straps tear within 2-3 wears. Some masks are even torn inside the packaging. This seems like a deliberate attempt to make people buy more as masks have become an essential commodity.

"
948,"

  Straps are very lose...similar mask which I used earlier were of good quality but these masks are probably are very old batch ..the straps get torn easily. Straps of Similar mask which I purchased from other place never gave away.. something is really wrong with this..u have to staple and use

"
949,"

  Of the 4 piece, received one defective. But I needed it badly so couldn't afford afford to return as rest 3 was good. Yet to use the product so can't comment on the quality but looks quite ok to me. Just concern was I hope the seller is not trying to push defective piece when someone order multiple piece in one go.

"
950,"

  Fake product ...waste of money...Elastic band came out from 3of the 5 masks of this lot during wearing for the first time itself...Pathetic

"
951,"

  I have bought this multiple times but the last couple of times the strap fusing is really bad. The strap cuts as soon as you try to use it. Looks like they are having quality issues in the part where the strap is kind of fused or heat stapled to the mask. Giving it a 3 because of that.

"
952,"

  Bad quality and build. Nose pin is so fragile, at the very first instance of expanding, it broke into two

"
953,"

  Worst product.strings got broken in a day. Poor workmanship.regret to buy.above all not returnable tag makes it more difficult to bear with this product

"
954,"

  More or less effective and airtight. Economic. But having some problem with strings and nose clips this time round. Nose clip is hurting the nose and strings are stiffer.

"
955,"

  Fits correctly.. Nice quality only problem is packaging.. Packing is not sterile.. That makes you doubt about its safety.. I think the manufacturer should do a sterile packing for each piece... Only then when ordered for minimal pieces sellers would not open the sterile packing ....

"
956,"

  An adjustable fit, comfortable to wear , light weight. I expect it to be priced below Rs 400 for a pack of four. Well packed and delivered in time.

"
957,"

  I am getting one pice mask in that no any branding . It's looking like a local .Rest pice mask is okay.

"
958,"

  Ordered this for 4th time...initially it was good quality mask with good quality straps..but now it comes with very low quality and straps getting broke down while wearing mask...not recommended

"
959,"

  Fake Venus product. Did not come in original packing. There is no 'Lot No.' printed, which can be confirmed from NIOSH site.

"
960,"

  The lace at the attachment split while wearing [ 2 of 4 were defective] . I am a doctor treating COVID patients. Purchased it for personal use. The firmness at the attachment is critical for safety. Poor quality assessment by seller.

"
961,"

  product is very loose and for this the entire mask is coming out from face

"
962,"

  Product quality is good but packaging is not up to the mark.

"
963,"

  Poor quality mask strings break easily after wearing only twice ...I am surprised as I use Venus masks in my hospital which are much better quality wise

"
964,"

  This mask is good, value for money. Even nose strap is good. It doesn't have steel nose clip. But keeping price in mind Rs 80 per mask , the quality is good.

"
965,"

  looks like a fake product despite NIOSH and TC no...don't go for it...straps comming out...does not fit properly in nose

"
966,"

  Comfortable. One can wear itfor many hours comfortably

"
967,"

  After using 30 minutes the belt gets detached from the mask.

"
968,"

  The thread broke after I used the mask twice. Also, one of the masks was defective, the metal was broken which is used to adjust the nose top area.

"
969,"

  Good product.. but strips are not good.. filterd good.. want to buy again..

  I doubt that product is original as i have been purchasing this product since June there is no lot number on mask and company instructions inside package.Zero for the Seller

"
972,"

  it's just like another ordinary mask with a high price. not original and came with poor packing.  you can buy this for less 100 per piece even if it's available from different vendor.

"
973,"

  The elastic band is really uncomfortable and the mask material quality is too bad. It’s torn on day 1 only!

"
974,"

  Do not buy this... Worst product ..The moment you try to wear the mask... It will tear apart..Such a waste of money!

"
975,"

  Product quality not up to the mark...

"
976,"

  I dislike the straps.. They come off easily.. Should b of more strength to withstand the stretching when one tries to wear it... That apart.. Value for money..

"
977,"

"
1005,"

  I’m using Venus N95 brand mask from May2020. But the one which I ordered this time looks to be a duplicate. Amazon has to review the seller.

  Mask is very good but Electrama Seller is selling the fake products.

"
1012,"

  Bad qualitywhat is the purpose of wearing a n95 mask with holes on it

  Quality of mask is poor. Elastic Band is not properly fixed to the mask and it gets detached in one use only.

"

  Ridiculously bad, it didn't lasted a single ware even. Either mask was torned from the middle and/or elastic came out

"

   The mask is undoubtedly NIOSH certified N95 mask, I verified the lot no. (There will be NIOSH N95 and lot no. stamped in black ink on right cheek side of mask)CONCLUSION:  I have used 3M N95 masks earlier, 3M masks are far better than these Venus masks. Venus masks definitely lack in overall quality control. But considering current situation knowing that it is NIOSH certified N95 masks and affordable. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED.⚠️⚠️ NEVER wash the mask NEVER. These masks loses filtration capacity if washed. After usage if the inside surface feels moist then sun dry the mask and preserve it in plastic wrap then wear the mask after 3 days. (Doctors are doing this in shortage of N95s).👍No size issue. One size fits all size face.👍The metal nose clip is good and flexible thus having no gap in ridges of nose.👍The fabric of mask is soft, flexible and breathable thus comfortable for long usage.👍The heat stiching on and around the mask is neat and clean leaving no pores thus sealing mouth and nose properly.👍The elastic straps are good. They have an adjusting mechanism to tighten the mask properly. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The straps are soft and doesnot create pain around ear or neck after prolonged usage.👍The inside surface of the mask is very comfortable to wear for long as all the adjoining points of straps and noseclip are properly concealed into layers of fabric.👎🏿In some masks the end of the straps was not not properly heat sealed onto mask surface. Don't know the durability of those straps.👎🏿Need improvement in heat sealing around the rim of the mask (in some masks, not all of them)DIRECTION FOR WEARING AND MAINTENANCE:1. Never touch the inside of the mask.2. Try not to touch the exterior of the mask frequently.3. Hold the mask by the straps while wearing and taking off.4. There are 2 straps first wear the lower strap around the neck and then wear the upper strap around your head over the ears.5. Then tighten the straps by the adjustable rings provided one for each straps.6. Pinch the nose clip such that airtight seal is formed inside mask.

  I had purchased these masks (Venus V-4400 Flat Fold Respirator) on 31st May 2020. These are N95 standard masks.That time the seller was 'Cloudtail India Pvt. Limited' and cost was Rs2835 for 10 masks.I repurchased the same mask same quantity on Sept 2020 but this time the price + delivery charg amounted to Rs 942 for 10 masks.  The seller this time was INDIANASTORES.The quality of these masks were completely different from the ones purchased in May 2020. The masks were thinner and the quality of material was not same. I have checked because I had a few unused mased which I purchased on May.How can a mask of same company and above all that is said to be made in compliance with an international standard- N95 be difcerent?Unfortunately since these are masks, these cannot return them.So the least that can be done is be very careful in checking the SELLER and buy only from trusted sellers.

"
1128,"

  Doesn't look like its original product. Its too light as compared to what a venus v4400 n95 should be and has a plastic nose clip instead of metal as in original.  They have copied the original really well but as i am a doctor using the same mask for last 7 months i can immediately tell that's its not same. It doesn't fit well on face and i can feel air escaping from all sides even when its fully tight and secure.  Morever most of the masks have manufacturing defects. It's a pity that its a non returnable item and i can't claim refund.

"
1129,"

  We ordered 10 pack masks. Got exact same. It's adjustable reusable. You can wash this masks gently. Price little bit high I guess. It's worth buying on online as there's no masks available in any stores.

"
1130,"

  I am really disappointed to receive this poor quality product from this seller. In fact during the first use itself both the strings of the mask were found detached from the substandard mask .  My sincere advice to the  customers , please don't get carried away with the advertisement of this sellers.

"
1131,"

  I had bought Venus masks multiple times since March 2019 and it was good quality product. I even still have a few I reuse. However this pack of 10 sold by Electrama was day light robbery. Bad quality. Every single mask strap broke before or during first use. Extremely disappointed. Please see picture. I have already 5 broken ones out of a batch of 10. Cheated..

"
1132,"

  3rd class product, I have tried a lot of masks in last 6 months or may be I used to wear masks even before the pandemic for Delhis pollution. This is the worst product, and the reason for me to be fooled twice is the quality of the first mask I bought from venus was the best mask I had ever bought.Believing in the quality of the first mask from venus I bought 10 of these. But these are some ill fitted no benefit at all mask in Corona times. You need to make sure that the mask seals all air gaps, but you just can't with this one, it gets slipping of your nose and you don't want to touch it every few minutes when you are out in public.Now I am doubting if its even a genuine venus n95 mask.

"
1133,"

  Quality of all the pieces in the packet are not same. Some are of very good quality. From some within one time use string comes out and irritating nose and mouth. Cloth and strap of some are of very bad quality.

"
1134,"

  It's fake as no Lot no. Mentioned that authenticates as per Venus website. Also observe closely No registered Trade Mark alongwith Venus name. See two pics one original, another fake without Lot no

"
1135,"

  Bought from reglow enterprisesCannot confirm whether these are original or fake. But definitely, the quality is not venus standard. Most of the bands are loosely attached against the mask at the glued ends which may easily tear off.I had been using these masks for almost a year and this the first time I have had such kind of experience. Previous sellers like cloudtail, Yugan lifecare and healthclues had provided durable and non defective products.

  Loose masks without any individual plastic for each. This is not acceptable medically and very risky. I being a doctor don’t recommend loose masks without their individual covers.

"
1148,"

  I had bought same mask earlier from different seller and they were genuine ones. But same product purchased from the new seller is of extremely poor quality. The straps will come even if you apply slightest of pressure as shown in picture! PATHETIC quality .

"
1149,"

  The straps ones out after one or two wear. Even the round clip that holds the straps comes out with one  pull. Amazon needs to verify the quality before allowing them to sell. No certification seen.  Stay away from spurious products

"
1150,"

  Mostly a low quality version of what we used to get  under the same label. Won’t recommend this again. Being a doctor with exposure risk, life is at stake. Thread snaps all of a sudden. Nose clip is stiff.

"
1151,"

  I got this product with perfect and seald condition, who got a damaged product that is unfortunate but it's not a regular mistake, so you can buy it and alsoto check it's authentication got to cdc website and search woth there TC no. you will get the brand name venus and also they provides lot no. which make it original, so buy without doubt, it's much good.

"
1152,"

  I doubt about the originality of the product. I hv purchased earlier the same product venus N95 mask which was much superior than the mask purchased from this seller. It seems very cheap in quality and material..

"
1153,"

  I have venus masks purchased from a Hospital dispensary and the quality of these masks are nothing compared to the masks purchased from the Hospital dispensary.  One mask's elastic band got removed by just pulling it over my face for the first time.  That's how substandard these masks are.  I don't even feel they are original venus masks.

"
1154,"

  I always use Venus 4400 N95 mask from the last 8 years. I genetally buy the product from medical store bt due to some issue I had ordered this item online first time. And found that it is not a original Venus 4400 N95 mask. It can be easily seen by its product quality.

   Looks like duplicate piece of Venus. I have used this mask in past they used to be a very durable. But this time mask thread broken on first day ( video attached). This happen three times. Thread to mask connection is weak.

"
1156,"

  Bought through Cloudtail,  costly but orignal ..  Rs200/piece

  Almost alll the packets are open. None of the packets are sealed. Can't make out whether they are used or fresh. Never trust online for medical products.

"

  Actually i don't know if it is original venus or fake usually I trust venus co. Product but this time bit disappointed becouse after using one day it looks so poor quality I am sorry and suggess people not to West your money.

"
1160,"

  Product is defective with holes in mask near strap punch area. Bought close to 20 masks after first 5 masks were good. Vendor is cheating on repeat orders. Playing with people lives in pandemic.Vendor : “Electrama“

"
1161,"

  Quality is much reduced, elastic is very tight and it breaks easily from the joint. I purchased because initially I had good experience but when I ordered again it comes with cheap quality.

"
1162,"

  Very cheap material..Thread is very loosely pasted to the mask, when I try to tiet it, it removed from the mask.. every mask has same problem..I never recommended any one to buy this product...

"
1163,"

  Although I was quite satisfied with my previous purchases of these masks, the recent set of masks delivered hugely disappointed me. Straps of multiple masks got torn on attempting to wear them,thereby rendering them useless.

"
1164,"

  Not good, the bands are very lightly stucked to the mask. A little strain during removing and wearing the mask, causing bands to come out from mask

"
1165,"

  It's not original Venus products they are poor quality I don't know why Amazon deceiving customers like this I felt very upset with Amazon

"
1166,"

  D nose pad is not steel like it is in original n95 venus

"

  although a good brand but prices vary a lot, some vendors are giving it for 90 rs ,I think the masks I got from you were overpriced ,this should not happen when we have a covid pandemic

"
1170,"

  Quality of mask as well as strap is not good at all. I have been using it since covid lock down. But, this is a very cheap in quality ....

"
1173,"

  The straps are very weak. Easily gets torn while putting the mask on.

"
1174,"

  Quality is detoriated as compared to previous

"
1175,"

  Nice product. It's washable

"
1176,"

  Not a genuine product. Not like the the same product I purchased from a hospital store earlier.

"
1177,"

  Not original

"
1178,"

  It's not tha original Vinus product as I used before. It's cheap quality thread does not last for 1 hour. Pathetic product.

"
1179,"

  Name of the seller - Healthclues. Its a fake Venus product.  Nose clips are loose. The mask is not fitting well on face.

"
1180,"

  Strings get detached. Not all sellers are genuine!!Comfort and fit are good.

"
1181,"

  String is very low quality

"
1182,"

  It isn't thick. Plus few masks didn't come in sealed package. Few packages inside were open.

"
1188,"

  Charged for 10 masks but delivered only 5. This is nothing but a cheatingOtherwise material is really nice.

"
1189,"

  It was a very poor product. The straps broke regularly and inside of mask was full of loose fibres irritating the nose

"
1190,"

  out of 10 mask only 9 nos had venus seal

"
1191,"

  Original N95 mask with NIOSH certification.

"
1192,"

  Looks like a Duplicate, not good......

"
1193,"

  Product cover was not sealed . Open pack of 10 masks , no idea now about the quality and sterility

"
1194,"

  Best genuine N-95 with NIOSH certification.

"
1195,"

  The strings attached will break in a second once you try to wear

"
1196,"

  Good products

"
1197,"

  Worst quality. Straps are easily torn and of shorter lengths. Don't buy this.

  very worst masks in the pack. out of 10 masks, 6 are damaged

"
1207,"

  Not original venus masks. Irritating inside stuff and gets me allergic

"
1208,"

  Some of the masks do not have a headband adjustment mechanism.

"

"
1226,"

  Good quality Masks ...have NIOSH standards so no need to worry about its efficiency...it is good with nose clip and adjustable head straps to tighten it according to ur size of head

"
1227,"

  Venus face masks are good, but the packing of the 10 nos. masks were not up to the mark. I feel each face masks should have plastic pouch rather than all masks are packed  into one plastic cover.

"
1228,"

  good product. niosh approved written on it. hope they are not cheating. strap is nice and adjustable.

"
1229,"

  Extremely cheap quality, not even properly packed.Doesn't look like a good brand.Should be sold for less than rs. 50 per mask.Also this product can't be returned.So please DO NOT BUY!!!

"
1230,"

  This is really good. Being a doctor myself I need to use it in a lot of situations and it has served me very well. Fit and finish is extremely good.

  Received product as described. People have to read about the types of respirators before ordering.

"
1238,"

  I have no idea whether it is real or fake... but as the way of packaging was done, it looks like fake product. Although masks are somewhat ok like. But i think a trusted company like venus never sell their product without a simple packaging.

"
1239,"

  Average qualityIndian products Can never match the brands and quality like 3M.

"

"
1276,"

  Definitely it's not a venus company masks..it was torn wen I got delivered..very poor quality..plz don't buy this..its fake

"
1277,"

  First impression:Looks genuine and authentic. The exhalation valve and the adjustable straps are pretty convenient. Overall, these are good masks for the price.  Removed 1 star for shoddy packaging.

"
1278,"

  I'm a doctor using N95 masks for work related hazard. These masks are original, comfortable to wear for long time due to the presence of exhalation valve. Competitively priced compared to open market. Overall satisfied. Buy from seller Sundaram's for original masks

"
1279,"

  This is free size but not suitable for sealers face..this is perfectly suitable for medium size faces to bigger faces.. actually this product is purchased for my mother...but finally am using..mostly gents prefer this product..don't buy ladies

"
1280,"

  Absolutely fake n95 masks. Total waste of money. Please do not buy this from Yugan Lifecare. Firstly it came in a very flimsy packet. The packaging of the mask was the entire packaging altogether. Secondly, its not real n95. There is no certification too. So please dont buy this. Its just a waste of money.

"
1281,"

  The product feels very good quality and it came packed in individual bags - all sealed.I now suspect that all the other Venus masks I have been purchasing (N95) have probably not been authentic.The quality and printing on this one and feel of the material and even straps are one of the best I have come across in the many masks I have purchased over the pandemic.I bought these from Healthclues.

"
1282,"

  The product is genuinely good. It’s comfortable, there is no fogging of the specs, breathing is clear and I hope it protects adequately. Mask sits firmly on the skin.

"
1283,"

  I have bought pack of 5 venus N95,But 3 pieces stitches had broken.Stitches are not good and 1piece Laastic is short. Bad product

"
1284,"

  This N 95 mask is not all comfortable to your ear and face. This product is costly if you take into account their quality.I am using 2 right now and there thread came out  after 2 days of use. I do not think that it is an N 95 mask as the valve is of inferior quality.

"
1285,"

  Amazing MASK.. good comfort... Worth buying.. I am a doctor at Govt hospital Goa.. find the mask amazing to use on duties

"

  It's difficult for person wearing spectacles because eyeglasses become foggy. Need to glasses while wearing mask.

"
1298,"

  Poor stitching. Waste if money

"
1299,"

  The venus N95 mask with valve is very hard on nose and hurts a lot if one wears it for a long time.....on a whole it is a complete waste of money......highly uncomfortable

"
1300,"

  The quality remains intact,so does the packaging. Wish you offered more pieces in a better deal for people who require such products regularly(like Healthcare workers)

"

  Good product! Doesn't fog my glasses. Works well.

  Product meets the expectations and requirements. Comfortable to wear.

"
1313,"

  Perfectly fits on and seals the face, can be worn for hours without feeling suffocated.

"

  Not good

"
1337,"

  After spending quite a sum, was surprised to see a long hair strand inside the packet!! Keeps on wondering about the sanitary condition!! Bought the item from cliudtail india.Otherwise the item seemed genuine.

"
1338,"

  How pathetic can a product be.Amazon is not working on good quality mask sellers .Strings broke the moment I wore the mask.Money got wasted once again and that too on masks.I should have learnt from my first mistake and shouldn't have bought mask again from Amazon.Wont repeat it again.Once again I would like to add PATHETIC QUALITY MASKS.

"
1339,"

  Excellent product by venus ,, absolutely genuine n95 product . As a doctor I am pretty impressed with the strings that can be tightened according to your head circumference. Great purchase.

"
1340,"

  Not a good product. After two use the string has come out. Received a poor quality or a old stock.

"
1341,"

  Very Worst Product i had purchased .The red colour band of the mask is going colour and It is breaking easily i had purchaed 2 no on offer they are very bad .In the same Yellow thread is Good

"

  Genuine N95 mask. Good stuff, but little expensive.

  In this price quality is not good. it's too costly

  The straps rip off even with careful handling.Venus V4400 original mask has red straps (can be seen on their website) and the photo shown on amazon also has red straps. But the product delivered has yellow straps. Even the manufacturer twitter handle has posted that only the masks with red straps are original and the mask with yellow straps are fake (see the photo I have posted).Do not buy. Surprised that this was sold by Cloudtail.

"
1361,"

  All three masks Just on my first usage one string which holds my head came off and mask became un usable. Only one mask usable As the return period is over I can't return them and I am in loss of 200×3= 600 rupees,

"
1362,"

  It is the best mask that I have ever purchased till date. I have gifted two pairs to my relatives. I would love to order it again.

"
1363,"

  Bought from two different sellers. Those from Luxtronic technologies Dehli were individually and very nicely packed by Venus.But those from Shiv Enterprize Gujrat through safety shelter were without individual packing. I dont know how many infected hands might have handled them? They had  hand packed these masks as if these were to be thrown away after use. Absolutely disappointed by the safety center.

"
1364,"

  Good mask. Wearing this mask does not cause any difficulty in breathing. The respiratory valve works very well, there is no gap.

"
1365,"

  Packaging was terrible.Just place 5 masks and sealed polythene bag.No company letter instruction no inner cover nothing .But masks are good

"
1366,"

  Packaging was extremely awful. The 5 masks were just stuffed in a small cardboard box and one of the masks had its purifier seal tampered due to the immense pressure inside the box. Overall the masks are good. The Nose Clip perfectly fits and stays in position. No problem in breathing. Good Product.

"
1367,"

  Very comfortable and they are unlike cloth masks. Perhaps airborne viruses can be stopped with these. Go for it.

"
1368,"

  I am totally disappointed with these masks wastage of money and don't buy these masks

"
1369,"

  Good product at a reasonable price

"

  Very bad product.. I think it is not original.. valve is defective pic attached.. strap removed before use.. don't buy...

  - Complete protection sealing the area of nose and mouth.- Valved Respirator allows easy breathing.- Washable.- No fogging of the eye wear.

  I always wear Venus mask. They are durable and washable.

"
1385,"

  Excellent!

"
1386,"

  Good

"
1387,"

  The filter on this mask is of very poor quality, it opens completely when you breath out. Not suitable for use in a raging pandemic

"
1388,"

  You can use whole day without any pain at ears. Quality is also very good.

"
1389,"

  Look is good. But packaging is not good. I think it is not original venus brand

"
1390,"

  Best mask

"

  Fake product printing is low quality and packing is poor same as duplicate products

"

  great comfort mask

"
1400,"

  What is the Protection ?

"
1401,"

  Very bad product .i had paid for 2 masks and they only sent 1 .thereafter,  no refund nothing ....never buy this product .

"
1402,"

  some of the masks have a broken inner layer. the makers should be punished strictly.i was just wearing them beleiving that venus would be up to standards.i was  rather surprised to see manufacturing defects in the inner layer of the mask.

"
1403,"

  Some have complained about the bad quality of the product. The Venus V4400 N95 mask I bought from IndianaStore are excellent. They may not be the cheapest but the quality of their item is very good.

"
1404,"

  I  recieved  Venus V4400 n 95 masks but very poor quality

"
1405,"

  Package was good. Each mask comes with Individually sealed cover. Received red strap mask. I am a doctor using this venus v4400 mask for the past  four months. So far quality is good.

"
1406,"

  Request to all please do not but this product at from this seller. Quality is very very poor. Some of the mask dont have nose PIN inside. Again requesting do not buy this product atleast from this seller. Same product Venus N95 4400 mask from other seller is very good quality.

"
1407,"

  I bought pack of 50, so that I can get original packing. It was shipped in individual packing. So not sure if they are original or not. Also, not sure they are hygienically okay, as some one re-packed it.

"
1408,"

  Nose pin doesnt fit properly.Doesn't come in original venus packing.Suitable for single use only.I bought from Indiana store.No issues with delivery.Product not returnable.

"
1409,"

  Very poor quality

"
1410,"

  This time most of the masks have short slings...And the glue is giving off...I used 20 from this package so far out of which 7 are wasted.Earlier orders were good

"
1411,"

  Lot of issues in the mask with 2 out of 5 masks strings snapping at the joint when wearing. Have lost atleast 10masks till now without using them. Never expected Venus to have such quality issues.

"
1412,"

  some of the masks have a broken inner layer. the makers should be punished strictly.i was just wearing them beleiving that venus would be up to standards.i was  rather surprised to see manufacturing defects in the inner layer of the mask.

"
1413,"

  Some have complained about the bad quality of the product. The Venus V4400 N95 mask I bought from IndianaStore are excellent. They may not be the cheapest but the quality of their item is very good.

"
1414,"

  I  recieved  Venus V4400 n 95 masks but very poor quality

"
1415,"

  Package was good. Each mask comes with Individually sealed cover. Received red strap mask. I am a doctor using this venus v4400 mask for the past  four months. So far quality is good.

"
1416,"

  Request to all please do not but this product at from this seller. Quality is very very poor. Some of the mask dont have nose PIN inside. Again requesting do not buy this product atleast from this seller. Same product Venus N95 4400 mask from other seller is very good quality.

"
1417,"

  I bought pack of 50, so that I can get original packing. It was shipped in individual packing. So not sure if they are original or not. Also, not sure they are hygienically okay, as some one re-packed it.

"
1418,"

  Nose pin doesnt fit properly.Doesn't come in original venus packing.Suitable for single use only.I bought from Indiana store.No issues with delivery.Product not returnable.

"
1419,"

  Very poor quality

  Very irritating as nose metal strip keep poking the nose very painfully.

"
1423,"

  Theere are so many defects present in the masks Nose clip not aligned  , head band is broken , head band material quality is very poor , it seems that seller mixed rejected masks with good masks

"
1424,"

  I got this product and it was damaged and asked customer care to replace they are asking to go and compliant wherever u want I am least bothered and I can’t help you out in this

"
1425,"

  Packaged individually in sealed poly packs. Box contains 10-20 masks. Finally packaged in another box.

"
1426,"

  Good quality but high cost

"
1427,"

  The quality of the masks are very bad , the straps come off easily. even the number of masks were not as advertised. I got only 14 nos instead of 25 nos.

"
1428,"

  Looks genuine Venus brand. Each piece is packed separately. Good comfort.

"
1429,"

  Material in short in supply and without originAL packing given us the impression that poor quality  material has been supplied in place o original one

"
1430,"

  It's smaller in  size... Compared to other venus masks sold by other sellers

"
1431,"

  Serves the purpose.

"
1432,"

  Quality is very bad...you are taking money but not doing your duty to provide best products

"
1433,"

  Average , smaller in size, I ordered 50 but in packed found 48 .

"
1434,"

  Very loose straps and it’s get broken very easily, Venus has lost the credibility.

  Definitely it ensures protection.. but unable to breathe free while climbing stairs or speaking aloud.. !! Would go for a thinner one next time.

"
1515,"

  In the past few months, I have tried many M95 masks. This one is the best. Flexible fit, no irritation, perfectly airtight and does not create vapor on glasses. Highly recommended.

"
1516,"

  I received genuine Venus masks from seller Safety Emart. Quite comfortable on the face because the strap length can be adjusted with locking mechanisms. Has metallic nose bridge support for fitting snugly over the nose. The mask features over the head type of straps, not over the ears. The price was very competitive. Highly recommended.

"
1517,"

  It's very difficult to give it ratings as the product is completely different, it's not at all venus mask, some other company with very cheap material and very very uncomfortable thing to wear,I don't know why people cheat in such kind of items..

"

"
1535,"

  Used this before also. A very good product. Specially for people with specs will feel the comfort more as the nose clip is good

"
1536,"

  In product specification and image it is specified as venus v44 but the one which they send is not venus and it is unfinished mask. It is not N95 as claimed.I would prefer to give negative rating for this.*******Dont buy this*******

"
1537,"

  Product is very average , Quality is not so good. Size is also small,

"
1538,"

  This product is deteriorating in terms of its quality.. ot was once upon atime too good product.. but now.. i got a pack of mask even without a cover.. the thread is too small and it feels too tight over face

"
1539,"

  Utter waste..

"
1540,"

  These are not Venus masks. Product is similar but not what is shown in picture.. This thing is now getting common on Amazon.

"
1541,"

  What a fraud since when ffp1 has been equal lent to n95 as n95 itself is Ffp2 stage mask

"
1542,"

  Totally disappointed with the product,nowhere venus written on the mask and back adjustable clip is not there,

"
1543,"

  Awesome product

"
1544,"

  Excellent

"
1545,"

  Poor packaging by SAFETY EMART. Not N95 grade but can be used as an ordinary mask for dust etc.

"

  The quality is inferior when compaired to the previous version of venus 44+ mask.....quality of packaging can be improvised

"
1550,"

  These masks seems original...nice fit...head straps are perfect in size...its cheaper when you buy 10 pieces together...

"
1551,"

  Worst product. Ditching customers by selling inferior quality masks. Rather than Venus brand masks, unbranded masks are being delivered.

"

"
1556,"

  all 10 masks were wrapped in a polythene and cardboard. not original packaging may be someone selling used masks online.

"
1557,"

  Inferior quality, Not Venus . worst fit, low quality threads that cause pain. Regret the purchase.  Never buy.

  These guys are charging a bomb for these thin n95 masks. Just capitalizing on the covid epidemic. Not worth the price and are for one time use. Build quality is just OK. They claim it to be n95, the authenticity of which can be hardly proven.

  Amazon never disappoints! Got this pack of 1 (2masks) for 400Rs. Amazon delivered it in just few hours from seller Cloudtail. Packaging is nice although would've loved to see the masks in a sealed pack rather than a stapled one. The masks, they're perfect. A quality product from Venus! It's genuine N95 and has NIOSH certification. Masks are top notch quality wise. The head band is really comfortable and way better than the one's with ear bands which hurts behind the ear. Thank you Amazon, Cloudtail and Venus. Stay safe everyone.

"
1613,"

  Don't buy it...very poor quality...

"

  This is one of the most geniun mask for protection against coronavirus. The seller is selling original product from Venus.

  Product looks genuine and is comfortable it is properly stamped...lot no..category ..etc...as shown in image. Color may vary from the one shown in image. Currently( in Covid pandemic) a lot of opportunist seller are selling the same product at a much higher rate and that without a guarantee of product genuiness. Stick to a reputed seller like cloudtail who are not taking advantage of Covid like others.

"
1628,"

  The mask are good.Each costs for 200/- rupees

"
1629,"

  This is probably the Best N95 mask around right now.Due to shortage of material and time spans, you might get different colours (we got grey).But this is a good mask:- Adequate filtering- Adjustable Pain-Free strap.- Nose Clip.

"

  When I ordered this mask, initially I thought it was the same product that is sold in Apollo pharmacy's. But once it was delivered, I found the mask to be very thin and unprotective in nature. This doesn't seem to be serving the purpose as it did with the Appollo pharmacy.

"
1631,"

  Sold above the MRP

"
1632,"

  Good mask. Doesn't dry after washing. 3 days requires to dry completely in this heavy mansoon.Packed in a thin polythene bag. So make sure you sterile it b4 use.After one use... I washed it.  But front stiching(or sticking)  got open as i uploaded in pictures.I stitched it with stiching machine. Can't throw it just like that bcoz it's costly.

"
1633,"

  The quality isn’t fine but I found the mask is little uncomfortable during wearing it ,It’s too tight around my ears side due to which it’s uncomfortable for me to breath so it’s just a fine Mask to purchase

"
1634,"

  Not a single starDNT buy , duplicate product.

"
1635,"

  Just perfect masksHead loops , attachment of strings, thickness , nose pin everything perfect 👌This time received white masks with yellow strings.Before 3 months when i ordered have got one defective  piece. But this time no such issue.Venus masks r the best. They proved it once again.

"
1636,"

  Worst produt..Description says pack of two and it one was delivered when I have paid for two - 440 rupeesI highly recommend not to buy this product as it's elastic quality is very cheap and it's not genuine !!Very disappointed with the purchase...

"
1637,"

  Poor quality and high cost.  Product shown & sent to me are totally different.

"
1638,"

  It says the mask is not washable.how am i supposed to use it multiple times without washing it?Go to a local medical shop and buy an n95 mask for 30 rs that will be of much better quality

"
1639,"

  It is very nice original venus n95 mask white in colour and yellow strip. I have easily clean by liquid hand wash after using this. I have given it 5star. Using after 2days now I am recomending this to buy.

"
1640,"

  Did not receive the product as shown in the picture. I had received a grey coloured and was feeling breathlessness within a few minutes of wearing it.

"
1641,"

  Relatively thinner ply materials are used. Breathable compared to many other masks specifically solimo and careview. Lesser fogging effect.

"
1642,"

  What a waste of product, its a fake product, picture is from original product but they despatch fake. 20₹ mask duplicate

"
1643,"

  Excellent product. Colour is super i.e grey. Original N95 mask from reputed brand Venus at Rs 200/- per piece at this time of lockdown. Thank u Amazon and Venus. Just go 4 it.

"
1644,"

  It's a pack of 2 for 400/- but I received only one (1). I am supposed to receive two (2) in a pack of 1 but I received one. Please send another one

"
1645,"

  This product is a fake one. They tried to copy the label printed on the item. It's not a Venus mask as claimed.

"
1646,"

  Nose clip is exposed to nose,Very poor quality product sold on amazontrying to contact but system defaults couldn’t

"
1647,"

  this my second purchase. I bought two pairs and gifted to my relatives. I am hopping to buy more. best mask I have ever purchased till date.

"
1648,"

  Good product ... sellers should think to provide gpod masks for leeser money in corona situations

"
1649,"

  Recieved one out of two. Not that useful through.

"
1650,"

  Looks fake product. No packaging or certification

"
1651,"

  Comes in lose package.Size also different than my privious one.Doubtful for authentication.

"
1652,"

  I just see 2 layer of cloth. No filters. Not sure who approved this mask as N95. N95 standard not met.

"
1653,"

  Strap size reduced thab bought previously and also strap broke from mask on days of use

"
1654,"

  Not comfortable and the straps are incorrectly stitched.. Not worth the price.. I doubt this is an N-95 mask as it claims.

"
1655,"

  good product

"
1656,"

  This is not standard quality and free flow of Air in side the mask may not arrest the bacteria and dust.This type of quality is not expected from the Venus Company.

"
1657,"

  Very good product and fits well to mouth, provides full safety

"
1658,"

  This is not a joke what are u trying to do.You guys are taking things very lightly and just an opportunity to encash the situations prevailing in the country.It seems like a boat and have end attached vertically , straightly making very unease for eyes.Highlyyyy not recommended.

"
1749,"

  Bought Venus N95 masks and used it for 15 days. Everyday washed it with soap foam & warm water, very effective & stayed clean. On 16th day put it under iron and all its layers got stuck together  destroying it. Its a great mask, made in india, not to be ironed, manage it gently.

"
1750,"

  There no plastic packing on the masks , they were just placed in amazon's packing ,As n95 masks r non washable , I had to spary disinfectant spray all over it and than put it under the sun for hours before it could use it l.

"
1751,"

  Worst packing and no safety instruction. Seller doing unethical business by using the current situation. It is not reusable too. Finally, it does not meet n95 standards.

"
1752,"

  Great product. Good quality and perfect fitting for anyone. Head loops make it perfect fit for large head like me.

  Price is very high.See the latest advisory regarding the prices of these masks.Can’t be sold more than RS. 100to150

"
1755,"

  Really its not even worth 150/ mask . It has open holes in it. Maximum price for this quality should be 50.Not worth the price...

  Very bad quality. I have bought same product from medical stores many times. But I bought this online twice, and both the time they sent very bad quality product. Band of mask got torn after 1st use. Total waste of money. It hurts as it is covid time and mask is like bread and butter to us.

"
1770,"

  This product is substandard. I very much think is not original N95 as it states. As I had to use it in the hospital  setting the authencity of the product was paramount. But the straps gave away in all the masks which I had purchased  and also the fit was not snug as it should be. There was air leak. There was a difference  in the venus N95 brought from the medical shops and through amazon.Very disappointed and it is a high risk to buy this product

"
1771,"

  I placed order for these masks based on a mask i received from a very well known hospital.However the masks I received through Amazon are pretty bad in quality.1. The string came off from a couple of them within 10 minutes of use.2. The material is much thinner than the one I have used earlier as mentioned above.

  The masks were received without any official Venus plastic covering/packaging- maybe Venus just sells the masks in a simple plastic cover. Also, the finishing of the Venus N95 masks seems to be somewhat poor as the 2 bands on the mask looked somewhat frayed at the ends. The other issue noticed with one mask of the 3 purchased was that the Venus logo, Lot no. and approval number stamp was a little too dark and distorted, while the stamping was a little faded/too light on another mask. Thus the authenticity of the Venus N95 masks cannot be determined for certain by me unfortunately. Although the CDC website does confirm that this model of Venus masks are N95 masks with the following Approval Number: 84A-8126 which was printed on these masks as well, but the Lot Number of the masks could not be verified and even verification of these two numbers do not give the wearer complete certainty of the genuineness of the masks received for various obvious reasons.

"
1813,"

  Went for this mask because of brand  but very poor quality, small size,strings easily broken etc.And good example of 'aapda me avsar' earlier price 5 pieces for 279 rupees now very costly

"
1814,"

  Bought this because I wanted a quality product. It had a NIOSH approval too. Was very disappointed. Started from the packaging which was very flimsy. No box apart from the Amazon carton. Just a flimsy plastic wrap outside the masks. Wore it for no more than 6 hours and this happened. The seams have already started to come off.

"
1815,"

  It's a gud product not excellent one. I pull the straps it's really gud those never come off easily.i give 7.5 out of 10. But it's doubt that are these 3 masks worth of 579 ? (With all taxes included)

  Mask quality is awesome. I highly recommend to  those who wants to buy n95 mask. All mask came with a separate package.

"
1853,"

  Nose pin was not proper

"
1854,"

  Quality of mask

"
1855,"

  I used to think venus is the best N95 mask. You proved me wrong.

"
1856,"

  Mask is too large to wear...Difficult to breath in this mask...

"
1857,"

  while wearing the ear portion connected was removed on all 3 sides

"
1858,"

  One piece was torn..i think this is not original

"

  Horrible masks !!

"

  Best quality 👍🏼

"
1862,"

  It is very comfortable and breathable mask . It's fits perfectly .It's cloth quality is awesome.

"
1863,"

  It covers from nose to mouth alright. But you feel like some cloth clip has been kept on your nose, because of the adjustable metal nose strip. Once you adjust it, it dents and deforms, making it really hard to bring it back to proper shape. :( Dunno what to do

"
1864,"

  Very disappointed. The masks arrived in an amazon envelope. Inside the masks were packed in ziplock bag. That means they are not packed by the manufacturers but by Amazon. Very unhygenic.Moreover, the colour is green😱

"
1865,"

  Gets torn vry easily

"
1866,"

  The mask is fine. Although the colour of the mask was not turquoise but white. please make sure you do not misrepresent any product.

"
1867,"

  Authenticated Venus product....bulilt quality is superb, comfortable to wear, fits well around the mouth and nose.

"
1868,"

  Total waste of money  . Fraud also . don't buy .

"
1869,"

  Once you wear, unable to breath, please don't buy.

"

  Slightly loose and overall fit was not as per expectations... could be better

  The straps gets cut once you get and stretch. It happened with me and as well as for two more people. This is even with the single use case. I had one from earlier purchase, that seems ok, but this purchase of 20 was a problem, as the mask no longer serves the purpose. Requesting the company officials to ensure that this does not happen. This snaps at a flight or in a common place and you are exposed completely. My experience was as early as yesterday. Not able to send photo, as i disposed off the maskNeed a reply from the company

"
1884,"

  Venus masks are one of the only trusted true N95 for medical professionals. My wife is a doc and she uses it every day. Some people suggest to reuse but I never suggest the same for these masks. Use it for the duty time and just dispose it

"
1885,"

  Almost all the masks are defective and torn... one day I was wearing a defective and torn mask for almost half the day in the office..

"
1886,"

  Not good one,  also thread gets broken faster...

"

  Not an original one. It's duplicate product. Quality is far lower than original one. Very disappointing.

  Not sure how to go ahead with this feedback. I am relieved to have a face mask at this point of time but feeling overly cheated at the high price of 700 for 2 masks. I am not sure what is stopping our honourable PM to take action against such unethical practices in such a pandemic situation.

  This is the worst mask ever used. This cannot be more than 10 apiece. Amazon should blacklist this company. I will write a complaint against this company soon. The mask received does not even match the one shown in the picture.

  It’s very breathable. It has adjustable nose clip and adjustable beads on the loops/head straps. It’s perfect for wearing long time.

"
1918,"

  Item is not as described in web, suppose to receive two pieces of mask, only one piece is recived.

"

  It's adjutable metallic nose pin is unique. Fits comfortably as per the requirement.Most comfortable, you can wear it for hours together continuously.

  Third class quality. First time i am feeling cheated by amazon.Low quality product and its showing as venus.

"

  It doesn't seems to be a original product.  It came in loose packaging. No brand packaging or box.

"
1933,"

  Amazing mask, does the job..covers the mouth and nose completely..

"
1934,"

  Its a duplicate venus.Mask has not any tag or symbol of venus.Totally, fake product.

"
1935,"

  Poor quality mask at higher rates..!!I doubt it’s a duplicate Venus mask..Haven’t expected this from a big brand like Amazon..!! Disappointed 😌

"
1936,"

  Packaging was unsatisfactory

"
1937,"

  Product is good but packaging is very poor and its a little over priced. Otherwise better than all other masks in the market .

"
1938,"

  useful for saving most part of the face in the covidian times

"
1939,"

  Can you confirm if the product is original as the marking on mask do not match with the one shown on Amazon

"
1940,"

  Looks like old product..colour faded from yellow mask, material not good. Packaging was worst.

"
1941,"

"
1977,"

  Not good for virus protection as it is ffp1 instead of ffp2

"
1978,"

  Stop exploiting consumers in this high time. This mask in market hardly costs rupees 40.  Bad experience.

"
1979,"

  Quality is not at all good. The elasticity of the head strap is gone. And the head strap is too loose even for people with large head.and mostly it appears like already used by someone.

"

  Valve quality is not good ... It does has space in between ...

  The product delivered is faulty. The mask delivered doesn't have any similarity with amazon product photographs. There is no direction how to use. It's very evident they are just doing business in the wake of this pandemic and not paying attention to the product itself! And it is not cheap either!

"

  Please use cloth made face mask rather than going for it. Material is cheap, no proper hold around the face, elastic breaks easily. Fake product. I am using my own mask i threw it.

"
2042,"

  Fake product. The product is nowhere close to what they've advertised.

"
2043,"

  Loop elastic is worst, don't buy

"
2044,"

  This is one of the only 2 companies with NIOSH approval in India to make N95 masks. The shapes is a bit weird but you can take solace that its a good product.

"
2045,"

  Fake product. Clearly cashing on the coronavirus panic.

"
2046,"

  It looks good, feels smooth but the stitching of elastic and the quality of elastic is substandard. It snapped on its own.

"
2047,"

  Fake product alert

"
2048,"

  I have been using this for the last 1 year. Tried other n95 masks too. But not this comfortable. Trust me,  it may not be good looking but damn good.

"
2049,"

  Inconvenient and poorly designed fake product - Suggest to avoid completelyFor me it was waste of money

"
2050,"

  It's totally different what is showing and what we received We should be given refund and replace

"
2051,"

  The fitting if this mask is very poor allows air entry inside, and the side straps are pathetic.. break off, very low quality..Altogether very poor Quality

"
2052,"

  It is complete waste of money.Please dont buy it, it should have been actually priced at 100 for two considering the product they have selling you. If you want to save your hard earned money kindly dont buy this product.

"
2053,"

  Not sure about protection level, but N95 mask is completely different from this product.If you are looking for regular use better buy some premium mask

"
2054,"

  It's a poor quality mask for which they have charged so highly. Sham!

"
2055,"

  Out of two, one did not have the nose clip.Feeling cheated, due to no return policy

"
2056,"

  It is totally unsatisfactory item because it doesn't fits at face hence it is totally useless

"

  Not good product. Strap broke even before first use. Not  at all suitable for use. Avoid this.

"
2062,"

  Very poor qualityWe can not say N95 qualityI am using N95 currently too. In comparison very very poor quality. It looks like China quality. Cost is also too high compare to quality

"
2063,"

  What did the manufacturer think when he developed this crap. Insane design. Very difficult to put it on face.

"
2064,"

  It only we can give no stars... Please avoid.

  I have been using this Mask recommended by Dr itself , they themselves wearing them, and its unfortunate to see that almost every one here donot know about this kind of flat masks.It very well blocks and cover the area, the printed thing has to be on Top and has a nose adjusting strip. The two strings provided needs to be worned from above the head, one string goes below the ear and other above the ear. The guy shown wearing the mask in the picture is the way it will look if you wear it properly and you can feel that it is indeed blocking the air ( thats how n99 and n95 masks work, you cannot expect them to be comfortable in breathing always as its purpose is to block 99-95% of the Air)First time i have seen people soo ignorant and simply commenting negative about such an effective masks used by doctors.Please donot get mislead by negative coments. Ask any doctor you want. Even on TV News Reports you can see Doctors wearing this kind of Flat Mask.

  These are waste mask the company magnum entire range of masks are waste, actually not satisfied the standard and purpose.. do not buy this

"
2118,"

  It's good , comfortable , atleast better quality from local market

"
2119,"

  Straps are flimsy. Economy model. It looks so thin at certain points/lines where the layers have been joined together, but it is NIOSH-certified N95.Wear it correctly-the straps are headbands, not ear-loops.Bought it from Amazon Fresh. [B085LKJLLW]

"
2120,"

  Is this mask reusable??

"
2121,"

  Can this be used for avoiding corona virus?

"
2122,"

  100% authentic N95 mask. I am a doctor myself. Do not get carried away by fake reviews. Buy this mask and stay protected from coronavirus.

"

  FFP1 is equivalent to 80 percent purification of particles less than 0.3 microns in size. Should go for this in this current pandemic situation because this one of the few masks with authentic ISI certificate. Other brands like 3M are either always unavailable or are being sold at much higher price than MRP. But be aware to buy only and only from "" Cloudtail India "" ^__^

"
2133,"

  Many people are claiming that they got a fake or duplicate mask but I wanted to tell you that I got original venus product because I bought it from cloudtail (amazon seller) so if you want the genuine product then buy it from cloudtail.  see this is  ffp1 class mask which means it can filter up to 80 percentage solid airborne particles and 95 percentage non oil-based particles and n95 can filter up to 95 percentage airborne particles so this is not n95 mask but this is far batter than surgical(3 ply),cloth and other cheap masks which you purchase from local market .

"
2134,"

  Good product,soft and effective , but not available all the time. Bought another 6 pc and delivered on 15/7/20

"
2135,"

  Well there's nothing great about the product.its a basic mask.not sure about the authenticity or quality but amidst a pandemic wat better can u expect .the nose clip is fine the loops are fine but thr outer most yellow later cover is so thin that I fear the nose pin clip might actually come out.didnt use it now and kept it outside after washing.packaging was a a basic see thru package.price wise I believe it shud be costing between 60rs max not 80-90 rs at all.Also those who are claiming about the good quality and genuine from cloudtail well mine is also from cloudtail seller and the product is average.

"
2136,"

  Waste of money duplicate one.

"
2137,"

  Very bad product. The elastic is loose and of poor quality. Secondly it makes you look like a swan or a pelican. No head used while designing it. Built and stitching is again very poor..

"
2138,"

  Not worth the price. Appears duplicate.

"
2139,"

  Not good

"
2140,"

  I wouldn't recommend this as this is every thin materialAnd not even n95Ps for any enquiries you can mail meAnd buy mask Goin to shop and checking material

"

  Being in the health care proffesion, we use these masks regularly. This particular mask was ill-fitting, and I developed rashes at the end of the day! For the first time.

  The elastic bands are not properly attached and is stapled. They will come out after a single use only.pathetic product.

"
2167,"

  Good quality product at affordable price

"
2168,"

  Of all the mask I have used, Venus has the best fitting and covers the mouth properly

"
2169,"

  would have given five star if not for the missing nosepin in one of the mask

"

  NOT N95 BUT EQUIVALENT.Everyone is trying to buy good quality masks in this corona time , these mask which i bought are orignal Venus V 44+ respirators only , These masks are BIS 9473:2002 rated , which is equivalent to N95 , n95 ratings are given by foreign institutions and bis stands for bereau of Indian Standards , 132 for one mask is not bad , packing was plane polythene , and was delivered on time , good job by seller !! Thanks

"
2196,"

  NOT a N95 maskThis is not certified N95 mask. If you want a certified N95 mask , the same company sells Venus V-4400 ( C ) which is N95 certified.Also, the fit is not that great, it doesn't fit well from bottom.Mask is good but has a different use. Please refer datasheet on venus website for more details.

"
2197,"

  Primarily, I have ordered three packet of this mask. As per their description they should provided me total 9 mask; but they delivered me only 6 mask. This is very disappointing.& the second thing is its quality, which is absolutely not so good. Infact those are very ordinary.But Now in this situation I don't return it.  In this crucial moment we need some masks, because those are unavailable at my place. 😢Moreover, delivery speed has satisfied me.

  Very simple .V44+ but not n95 but it is head mount.purchese another product of Venus which will be n95 mask .All product of Venus is head Mount it is good to wear than ear loop.

"
2202,"

  It doesn't deserve star rating , it is a fake product, doesn't cost more than 20 rs, image and product are different and quality is third grade, 3rs, ply mask is better than this.

"
2203,"

  Small pore appear below the nose pin which may be dangerous for entering dust or other things. It means mask not properly covered.

  I am very very disappointed with this kind of product. During use for the first time the girders of the mask comes out as the stapler pins are rusty.

"
2225,"

  Not good

"
2226,"

  Product came as expected and is a good mask.

"
2227,"

  Not n95. Its ffp1, very much inferior to ffp2

"
2228,"

  Size of the mask is too small and the rubber band of the mask is torn after one time use🙂.

"
2229,"

  Product is not upto the mark. The colour of product show like it is used.

"

  Sold loose masks , no internal packing for masks.

"

  Received a venus original mask, quality was superb.

"
2260,"

  As one can read on the mask and also from Venus web page, this is FFP1s, which means it can reduce fine particulate matter up to 0.3 micron by 80%. This is way below N95 standard, which reduces fine particulate by 95%.While this is reasonable to use as a protection, but is not adequate if there are Covid-19 patients around.Given the price, better go for buying Venus V-4420 mask, which is FFP-2s, and stops 94% of the fine particulate.Avoid this one.

"
2261,"

  The best part about these masks apart from quality and durability is, these don't stick to your nose and mouth like surgical or cloth masks. I believe that's one of the the most important features as the space provided extra protection.

"
2262,"

  Poor Quality. Elastic Strings Have been Stapled Om Masks. Which Breaks Easily. Then you will have to fix it with Needle and Thread sewing it. Afte 2-3 Wash the Lint coming out from Fabric Makes it so thin. I have doubts if this can save you from Virus.

"
2263,"

  Very Good and standard quality product.Far better than available local N95 mask. We can use it by don't disturbing ear.

"
2264,"

  Don't buy..looks so bad ..seems different that shows in picture.i personally got astonished when I see its original pack..duplicate Venus

"
2265,"

  In this item 20 Number of Memory Sticks mention what about the memory Sticks... please

"
